"""If I walk from node d9 to node aa and take a left turn which node will I reach first?"""

ASSISTANT:

"""To determine which node you will reach first if you walk from node "d9" to node "aa" and then take a left turn, we need to look at the nodes connected to "aa" and identify the left turn from "aa".
From the JSON structure:
Node "aa" is connected to:
Node "d9"
Node "47"
Node "69"
Node "99"
Since you're starting from node "d9" and reaching node "aa", taking a left turn would typically mean turning towards the next node that is positioned to the left relative to your current direction of movement. Based on the provided positions and assuming you're facing north when reaching "aa" from "d9":
"d9" to "aa" positions: (339, 317) to (507, 319) indicates you're moving east.
A left turn from this direction would point you north.
Among the connected nodes to "aa", the one positioned north (left turn) is "47":
"47" position: [503, 148]
Therefore, if you walk from node "d9" to node "aa" and take a left turn, you will first reach node "47"."""

"""If I walk from node ba to node 69, which direction am I walking?"""

ASSISTANT:

"""To determine the direction you are walking when moving from node "ba" to node "69", we can look at the positions of these nodes in the JSON structure.
Node positions:
Node "ba": [790, 667]
Node "69": [686, 501]
Given these coordinates:
Node "ba" is located at (790, 667)
Node "69" is located at (686, 501)
Calculating the Direction:
The x-coordinate decreases from 790 to 686.
The y-coordinate decreases from 667 to 501.
Since both the x and y coordinates are decreasing, you are moving in a direction that is generally north-west.
Direction Analysis:
A decrease in the x-coordinate indicates movement towards the west.
A decrease in the y-coordinate indicates movement towards the north.
Conclusion:
When walking from node "ba" to node "69", you are walking in a north-west direction."""

"""If I walk from node 79 to node 99, which direction should I turn to reach node e3?"""

ASSISTANT:

"""To determine the direction you should turn to reach node "e3" after walking from node "79" to node "99," we need to look at the relative positions of these nodes.
Node positions:
Node "79": [883, 133]
Node "99": [893, 315]
Node "e3": [1124, 309]
Movement Analysis:
Walking from node "79" to node "99":
"79" is located at (883, 133).
"99" is located at (893, 315).
Moving from "79" to "99" involves primarily moving south (as the y-coordinate increases significantly more than the x-coordinate).
Determining the direction to node "e3" from node "99":
"99" is located at (893, 315).
"e3" is located at (1124, 309).
Moving from "99" to "e3" involves primarily moving east (as the x-coordinate increases significantly and the y-coordinate remains almost the same).
Conclusion:
After walking south from "79" to "99", you should turn left (east) to reach node "e3"."""
