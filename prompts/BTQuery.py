Your job is to design a Behavior Tree using the BehaviorTree.CPP library in XML according to the [BEHAVIOR] described by the user, using only the existing actions and conditions. 
The tutorial below will explain how to design behavior trees in XML:

- The first tag of the tree is <root> with the attribute 'main_tree_to_execute'. It should contain 1 or more tags <BehaviorTree> and the The tag <BehaviorTree> should have the attribute [ID]. E.g:
    <root main_tree_to_execute = 'SaySomething'>
    ....
    <BehaviorTree ID="SaySomething>
    ...
    </BehaviorTree> 
    </root>
- The <BehaviorTree> tag can contain only 1 child node (including Fallback, Sequence, Action and Condition Nodes)
- Sequence and Fallback nodes contain 1 to N children and dictate control flow in the behavior tree.
    - Sequence nodes execute their children in order and return Success only if ALL CHILD NODES returned SUCCESS. (like an AND gate).
        - Each sequence node typically has multiple child nodes
    - Fallback nodes execute their children in order and return Success if ANY CHILD NODE SUCCEEDS(like an OR gate). 

- Each Sequence and Fallback TreeNodes are represented by a single tag with an associated name. E.g.:
    <Fallback name="SaySomething 1">
        <Sequence name = "SaySomething 2">
            ....
        </Sequence>
    </Fallback>
JSONe">
        <Sequence name="RegNav">
            <SetBlackboard output_key="agentid" value="{id}" /> <!--Main tree creates a blackboard entry 'agentid' with the value retrieved from the blackboard entry "id" -->
            <SetBlackboard output_key="timestep" value="{dt}" /> <!--Main tree creates a blackboard entry 'timestep' with the value retrieved from the blackboard entry "id" -->
            <SubTree ID="RegularNavTree" id="agentid" dt="timestep" /> <!-- The "id" and "dt" ports of the subtree are mapped to the agentid and timestep ports of the main tree blackboard --> 
        </Sequence>             
    </BehaviorTree>

The following Action Nodes, Condition nodes and Decorators are available to use and can be composed into behavior trees to achieve the user's request. 

    - BT Conditions
        - IsRobotVisible(agent_id ,distance) : returns Success when the robot is within the input distance of the agent and visible(in line of sight) to the agent. Distance is in meters. 
        - IsRobotNearby(agent_id, distance) : returns Success when the robot is near the agent within the input distance. Distance is in meters.
        - IsGoalReached(agent_id) : returns Success if the agent has reached their current goal
        - TimeExpiredCondition(seconds, ts, only_once): Creates a timer and returns SUCCESS if the input duration in seconds has expired since ticking this node the first time (and FAILURE otherwise). If only_once = False, then the timer repeats (use this for periodically occuring behaviors).
        - RobotSays(agent_id, message) : Returns Success if the robot is currently performing a gesture corresponding to the message(int) passed to the functions. Messages correspond to gestures as: [0 (No gesture), 1("WAIT"), 2("PROCEED"),3("ACKNOWLEDGED"),4("EXCUSE ME")].
        - RobotMoved(agent_id): Returns success if the robot has non zero velocity.
        - IsRobotBlocking(agent_id, distance): Returns Success if the robot is in direct line of sight of the agent and within the input distance. Distance is in meters.
    - Note: In the simulator, for distance, 0.5 is considered very close, 1.0 is considered very closed, 2.0 is considered moderate distance and 5.0 is considered far
    - BT Actions:
        - UpdateGoal(agent_id) : Updates the goal of the agent to the next goal in the agentâ€™s goal queue
        - MakeGesture(agent_id,message): Makes the agent perform a gesture. Choices are: [0 (No gesture), 1("WAIT"), 2("PROCEED"), 3("EXCUSE ME")]. Initial value is 0 and once this node is ticked, the agent will keep making the gesture until it is set back to 0. 
        - RegularNav(agent_id,time_step) : Makes the agent perform standard social-force-model based motion planning, where the robot is treated as a normal obstacle.
        - LookAtRobot(agent_id) : Makes the agent look in the direction of the robot
        - FollowRobot(agent_id,time_step): Makes the agent follow the robot
        - AvoidRobot(agent_id,time_step): Makes the agent overly avoid the robot.
        - GiveWaytoRobot(agent_id,time_step): Makes the agent give way to the robot.
        - BlockRobot(agent_id,time_step): Makes the agent move in front of the robot and block it
    
    - BT Decorators:
        - Inverter: An inverter block inverts the output of its children (If children output failure, inverter outputs success and vice-versa).

The following behavior tree is available for including as a subtree, which implements a simple obstacle-avoiding human:
    - BTRegularNav.xml:         
    <root main_tree_to_execute = "RegularNavTree">
        <BehaviorTree ID="RegularNavTree">
            <Fallback name="RegularNavFallback">
                <Sequence name="RegularNavigation">
                    <Inverter>
                        <IsGoalReached agent_id="{id}" />
                    </Inverter>
                    <RegularNav agent_id="{id}" time_step="{dt}" />

### Explanation
#### Main Tree Execution
The main tree to execute is specified as `WaitForProceedTree`.
#### Included File
The tree includes another behavior tree defined in `BTRegularNav.xml`. This file likely contains the behavior for regular navigation using the `RegularNavTree` ID.
#### Fallback Node (`VisibilityFallback`)
The root node of the `WaitForProceedTree` is a fallback node named `VisibilityFallback`. A fallback node executes its children from left to right and returns `SUCCESS` if any child node returns `SUCCESS`. If all children return `FAILURE`, then the fallback node returns `FAILURE`.
#### First Sequence Node (`WaitForProceed`)
The first child of the fallback node is a sequence node named `WaitForProceed`. A sequence node executes its children from left to right and returns `FAILURE` if any child node returns `FAILURE`. If all children return `SUCCESS`, then the sequence node returns `SUCCESS`.
1. **`IsRobotVisible` Condition**
    - Checks if the robot is visible within a distance of 4.0 units from the human agent.
    - If the robot is not visible, this condition returns `FAILURE`, causing the sequence to fail and the fallback to proceed to the next child.
2. **`RobotSays` Condition**
    - Checks if the robot is saying "PROCEED" (message code 2).
    - If the robot is not saying "PROCEED", this condition returns `FAILURE`, causing the sequence to fail and the fallback to proceed to the next child.
3. **`MakeGesture` Action**
    - Makes the human agent stop any gesture (message code 0).
    - If this action is successful, the sequence returns `SUCCESS`, causing the fallback node to return `SUCCESS` as well.
#### Second Sequence Node (`RegNav`)
If the first sequence (`WaitForProceed`) fails, the fallback node proceeds to execute the second sequence node named `RegNav`.
1. **`SetBlackboard` Actions**
    - Sets the blackboard key `agentid` to the value of `{id}`.
    - Sets the blackboard key `timestep` to the value of `{dt}`.
2. **Subtree (`RegularNavTree`)**
    - Executes the `RegularNavTree` subtree using the `agentid` and `timestep` values set in the blackboard.
    - This subtree contains the regular navigation behavior for the human agent, likely involving obstacle avoidance and standard motion planning.
### Summary
The human agent's behavior can be summarized as follows:
1. The agent first checks if the robot is visible within a 4.0 unit distance.
2. If the robot is visible, the agent then checks if the robot is saying "PROCEED."
3. If the robot is saying "PROCEED," the agent stops any gestures.
4. If either the robot is not visible or the robot is not saying "PROCEED," the agent proceeds with its regular navigation behavior defined in `BTRegularNav.xml`."
        'ANSWER': "### Errors in the Behavior Tree corresponding to the Given Behavior
1. The above behavior tree doesn't do RegularNav if the RobotSays "PROCEED" condition is satisfied and instead just calls the MakeGesture action.
### Corrected Tree
Below is the corrected behavior tree to implement the given behavior exactly.
