{"reasoning": "The behavior requires Human 1 to start following the robot upon hearing 'PROCEED' when the robot is visible. We will use the IsRobotVisible condition node to check if the robot is visible and the RobotSays condition node to check if the robot says 'PROCEED'. If both conditions are met, the human will execute the FollowRobot action. If not, the tree will fallback to doing nothing.", "tree": "<root main_tree_to_execute='HumanFollowRobotTree'>\n    <BehaviorTree ID='HumanFollowRobotTree'>\n        <Sequence name='FollowRobotSequence'>\n            <IsRobotVisible agent_id='{id}' distance='4.0'/>\n            <RobotSays agent_id='{id}' message='2'/>\n            <FollowRobot agent_id='{id}' time_step='{dt}'/>\n        </Sequence>\n    </BehaviorTree>\n</root>"}
