{"reasoning": "To orchestrate the scenario where the robot is guiding employees to a safe exit due to an emergency, we need to plan the robot's trajectory from the east passageway towards the west passageway, while collecting the employees along the way. The robot will start in the east section of the warehouse near the open packaging area and travel towards the west passageway where the emergency exit is located. The employees are positioned as follows: Human 1 is near the north intersection of the passageways, and Human 2 is by a rack in the center of the warehouse. All involved humans are part of the same group as they are being guided together by the robot.", "trajectories": {"ROBOT": ["79", "99", "cf", "ba", "cb", "0e"], "HUMAN 1": ["99", "cf", "ba", "cb", "0e"], "HUMAN 2": ["cf", "ba", "cb", "0e"]}, "groupids": {"HUMAN 1": 1, "HUMAN 2": 1}}
