{"scenariodescription": "The robot is transporting boxes from one end of the warehouse to the other. As it navigates through the Passageways, it takes a turn at a blind corner near an Intersection and encounters an employee. The employee only sees the robot when it is very close and stops completely until the robot moves past and does not block the path anymore. The encounter happens near a rack stack in the warehouse.", "numberofhumans": 1, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is walking around the warehouse performing daily duties. When Human 1 sees the robot very close at the blind corner, they stop completely and wait for the robot to pass until the robot is no longer blocking their path."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot should stop immediately as it sees the human very close, say 'EXCUSE ME' to indicate its presence, wait for the human to stop moving and then proceed past the human carefully to ensure it is not blocking the human's path.
