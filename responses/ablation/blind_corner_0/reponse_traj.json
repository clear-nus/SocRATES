{"reasoning": "To create a scenario where a robot is transporting boxes from one end of the warehouse to the other and encounters an employee at a blind corner near an intersection, we need to plan the robot's trajectory and the employee's position. Each scenario component must align with the described situation, including the blind corner, encounter, and employee's response to the robot. A blind corner near an intersection where the robot encounters the employee near a rack stack is well-defined in this context.", "trajectories": {"robot": ["11", "07", "f7", "d9", "aa"], "human 1": ["07"]}, "groupids": {"human 1": -1}}
