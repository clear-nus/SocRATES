{"reasoning": "To implement the described behavior, we'll use a combination of conditions and actions to ensure that Human 1 stops immediately upon seeing the robot very close and then waits until the robot moves out of the way before continuing. Here\u2019s the breakdown of the behavior tree design:\n\n1. We start by checking if the robot is within a very close distance (0.5 meters) and is visible using the `IsRobotVisible` condition.\n2. If the robot is very close and visible, Human 1 will wait using a loop with the `RobotMoved` condition to check if the robot has moved out of the way.\n3. Once the robot moves out of the way, Human 1 will reset their gesture (if any) and resume the normal navigation behavior encapsulated in the `RegularNavTree` subtree.\n4. If the robot is not visible, Human 1 will continue navigating normally using the `RegularNavTree` subtree.\n\nThe fallback node ensures that Human 1 will either wait and move if the robot is visible or continue navigating normally if the robot is not visible.", "tree": "<root main_tree_to_execute='Human1BehaviorTree'>\n    <include path='BTRegularNav.xml'/>\n    <BehaviorTree ID='Human1BehaviorTree'>\n        <Fallback name='VisibilityFallback'>\n            <Sequence name='WaitUntilRobotMovesOut'>\n                <IsRobotVisible agent_id='{id}' distance='0.5'/>\n                <Inverter>\n                    <RobotMoved agent_id='{id}'/>\n                </Inverter>\n                <MakeGesture agent_id='{id}' message='0'/>\n            </Sequence>\n            <Sequence name='RegularNavigation'>\n                <SetBlackboard output_key='agentid' value='{id}'/>\n                <SetBlackboard output_key='timestep' value='{dt}'/>\n                <SubTree ID='RegularNavTree' id='agentid' dt='timestep'/>\n            </Sequence>\n        </Fallback>\n    </BehaviorTree>\n</root>"}
