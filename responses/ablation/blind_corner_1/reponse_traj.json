{"reasoning": "To create a scenario where the robot is transporting boxes through the passageways and encounters a human worker at a blind corner intersection near Rack A and Packaging Area 1, we need to identify suitable nodes and passageways that fit the description. The intersection near Rack A and Packaging Area 1 is node 'f7'. We will make the robot start from a position and take a turn at this blind corner (f7), encountering a human who stops completely until the robot is no longer blocking its path.", "trajectories": {"ROBOT": ["d9", "f7", "07"], "HUMAN 1": ["aa", "d9", "f7"]}, "groupids": {"HUMAN 1": -1}}
