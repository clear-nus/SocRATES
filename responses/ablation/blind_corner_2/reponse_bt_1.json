{"reasoning": "To create a behavior tree where Human 1 stops completely when they see the robot very close (distance of 0.5 units) and waits until the robot is no longer blocking their path before continuing to their destination, we can use the `IsRobotBlocking` condition. When the robot is no longer blocking, Human 1 will proceed with regular navigation using the RegularNavTree subtree. We can use a Fallback node to handle these two scenarios: a Sequence node to handle stopping and waiting for the robot to move out of the way, followed by another Sequence node for regular navigation.", "tree": "<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>\n<root main_tree_to_execute='Human1BehaviorTree'>\n    <include path='BTRegularNav.xml'/>\n    <BehaviorTree ID='Human1BehaviorTree'>\n        <Fallback name='BlockingFallback'>\n            <Sequence name='BlockingSequence'>\n                <IsRobotBlocking agent_id='{id}' distance='0.5'/>\n            </Sequence>\n            <Sequence name='RegNav'>\n                <SetBlackboard output_key='agentid' value='{id}' />\n                <SetBlackboard output_key='timestep' value='{dt}' />\n                <SubTree ID='RegularNavTree' id='agentid' dt='timestep' />\n            </Sequence>\n        </Fallback>\n    </BehaviorTree>\n</root>"}
