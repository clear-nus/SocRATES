It takes a right turn at a blind corner, where a human employee is walking from the left Passageway towards the intersection. The robot and the human encounter each other immediately at the corner. The robot is very close to the human when they first see each other.", "numberofhumans": 1, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 sees the robot very close and stops completely. The human waits until the robot is no longer blocking their path before continuing to their destination."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot stops immediately upon detecting the human. It says 'EXCUSE ME' and waits for the human to acknowledge. Once the human stops, the robot navigates around the human if possible, otherwise, it waits until the human continues walking and clears the intersection."}
