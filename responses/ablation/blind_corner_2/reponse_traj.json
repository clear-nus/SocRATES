{"reasoning": "To create the scenario where the robot is transporting a box through the passageways of the small warehouse and takes a right turn at a blind corner, encountering a human employee walking from the left passageway, we need to carefully plan the robot's trajectory and the human's trajectory. The encounter should happen immediately at the corner, and both should be very close when they first see each other. The scenario does not mention any groups, so the human will have a group id of -1 by default. ### Scenario Setup: 1. The robot is transporting a box through the passageways. 2. The robot takes a right turn at a blind corner. 3. A human employee is walking from the left passageway towards the intersection. 4. The robot and the human encounter each other immediately at the corner and are very close to each other. ### Selected Intersections and Passageways: - **Blind Corner (Intersection)**: Node '07' (CORNER) ### Robot's Trajectory: 1. **Start at node 'f7'**. 2. **Move to node '07'** (blind corner). 3. **Take a right turn at '07'**. ### Human's Trajectory: 1. **Start at node '11'**. 2. **Move to node '07'** (Intersection at blind corner). ### Detailed Node Sequence for the Robot and Human: #### Robot's Nodes: 1. f7 2. 07 #### Human's Nodes: 1. 11 2. 07 ### Path Visualization: - **Robot's Path**: f7 \u2192 07 - **Human's Path**: 11 \u2192 07 ### Simulator Initialization: 1. **Robot**: - Starts at node 'f7'. - Follows the path: f7 \u2192 07. - Takes a right turn at node '07'. 2. **Human Employee**: - Starts at node '11'. - Follows the path: 11 \u2192 07. - Approaches the blind corner from the left. ### Steps to Simulate: 1. Initialize the robot at node 'f7' with a box. 2. Set the robot to move along the path f7 \u2192 07 and take a right turn at '07'. 3. Initialize the human employee at node '11'. 4. Set the human to move along the path 11 \u2192 07. 5. The robot and the human will encounter each other immediately at the corner (node '07'). This setup ensures that the robot, while transporting a box, takes a right turn at a blind corner and encounters a human employee walking from the left passageway towards the intersection, with both very close to each other when they first see each other.", "trajectories": {"ROBOT": ["f7", "07"], "HUMAN 1": ["11", "07"]}, "groupids": {"HUMAN 1": -1}}
