{"reasoning": "To model the behavior where Human 1 stops completely and waits until the robot is no longer blocking their path once it becomes visible, we need to use a sequence that checks for the robot's visibility and whether it is blocking Human 1. If the robot is blocking the path, the human should wait until it moves out of the way. In the meantime, the regular navigation should be paused. To implement this, we will use a sequence node for the visibility and blocking check, falling back to regular navigation when the robot is not blocking the path.", "tree": "<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>\n<root main_tree_to_execute='Human1WaitForRobotTree'>\n    <include path='BTRegularNav.xml'/>\n    <BehaviorTree ID='Human1WaitForRobotTree'>\n        <Fallback name='VisibilityAndBlockingFallback'>\n            <Sequence name='WaitUntilRobotNotBlocking'>\n                <IsRobotVisible agent_id='{id}' distance='4.0'/>\n                <IsRobotBlocking agent_id='{id}' distance='0.5'/>\n            </Sequence>\n            <Sequence name='RegNav'>\n                <SetBlackboard output_key='agentid' value='{id}'/>\n                <SetBlackboard output_key='timestep' value='{dt}'/>\n                <SubTree ID='RegularNavTree' id='agentid' dt='timestep'/>\n            </Sequence>\n        </Fallback>\n    </BehaviorTree>\n</root>"}
