{"reasoning": "To create a behavior tree where Human 1, upon suddenly seeing the robot very close at a blind corner, stops completely and waits until the robot is no longer blocking its path before continuing to walk through the passageway, we can use the following logic: If the robot is very close and blocking the path, the human will stop. We use `IsRobotBlocking` condition to check if the robot is blocking the path. If so, the sequence will fail, making the fallback node return failure and stop any action. When the robot is no longer blocking, the human continues with regular navigation.", "tree": "<root main_tree_to_execute='HumanWaitUntilRobotPassesTree'>\n    <include path='BTRegularNav.xml'/>\n    <BehaviorTree ID='HumanWaitUntilRobotPassesTree'>\n        <Fallback name='BlockageFallback'>\n            <Sequence name='BlockageSequence'>\n                <IsRobotBlocking agent_id='{id}' distance='1.0'/>\n                <MakeGesture agent_id='{id}' message='1'/> <!-- WAIT Gesture -->\n            </Sequence>\n            <Sequence name='RegNav'>\n                <MakeGesture agent_id='{id}' message='0'/> <!-- No Gesture -->\n                <SetBlackboard output_key='agentid' value='{id}'/>\n                <SetBlackboard output_key='timestep' value='{dt}'/>\n                <SubTree ID='RegularNavTree' id='agentid' dt='timestep'/>\n            </Sequence>\n        </Fallback>\n    </BehaviorTree>\n</root>"}
