As it takes a turn at a blind corner, it encounters an employee who was walking towards the intersection from the other side. The passageway is narrow, and the human employee suddenly sees the robot when it is very close. The scenario takes place at an intersection created by the passageways in the warehouse.", "numberofhumans": 1, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 suddenly sees the robot very close at the blind corner. Human 1 stops completely and waits until the robot is no longer blocking its path before continuing to walk through the passageway."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot should immediately stop when it detects the human is very close at the blind corner. The robot then says 'ACKNOWLEDGED' to the human. After the human has stopped, the robot should proceed carefully and navigate around the human without blocking its path, allowing the human to continue walking."}
