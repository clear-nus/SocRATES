{"reasoning": "To create the scenario where a robot is transporting boxes and takes a turn at a blind corner to encounter an employee walking towards the intersection from the other side, we need to identify a suitable blind corner created by intersections and passageways. The passageway should be narrow and intersect with another passageway. The robot and the human employee suddenly encounter each other at close proximity at the intersection. An appropriate setup can be at the intersection node 'd9' where multiple passageways converge, making it a suitable blind corner scenario.", "trajectories": {"ROBOT": ["07", "f7", "d9"], "HUMAN 1": ["99", "aa", "d9"]}, "groupids": {"HUMAN 1": -1}}
