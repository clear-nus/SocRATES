{"reasoning": "The behavior tree needs to model Human 3's behavior at an intersection. When the robot says 'EXCUSE ME' (gesture code 4), Human 3 will actively avoid the robot until the robot is no longer nearby. If the robot does not say 'EXCUSE ME', Human 3 will remain standing and talking. The following tree includes sequences for handling both cases.", "tree": "<root main_tree_to_execute='Human3BehaviorTree'>\n    <BehaviorTree ID='Human3BehaviorTree'>\n        <Fallback name='RootFallback'>\n            <Sequence name='AvoidRobotSequence'>\n                <RobotSays agent_id='{id}' message='4'/>\n                <IsRobotNearby agent_id='{id}' distance='2.0'/>\n                <AvoidRobot agent_id='{id}' time_step='{dt}'/>\n            </Sequence>\n            <Sequence name='StandAndTalkSequence'>\n                <MakeGesture agent_id='{id}' message='0'/>\n            </Sequence>\n        </Fallback>\n    </BehaviorTree>\n</root>"}
