{"reasoning": "To achieve the desired behavior for Human 1, the behavior tree should be designed with these considerations: 1) Check if the robot says 'EXCUSE ME' using the RobotSays condition node with message code 4. 2) If the robot says 'EXCUSE ME', Human 1 looks at the robot using the LookAtRobot action node. 3) Human 1 then avoids the robot until it is not close anymore using the AvoidRobot action node in combination with a condition node to check if the robot is nearby. If the robot is not saying 'EXCUSE ME', Human 1 continues to stand in the group by doing nothing specific (maintains the current state). The `Fallback` node is used to handle these alternative behaviors.", "tree": "<root main_tree_to_execute='Human1IntersectionTree'>\n    <BehaviorTree ID='Human1IntersectionTree'>\n        <Fallback name='ExcuseFallback'>\n            <Sequence name='ExcuseMeSequence'>\n                <RobotSays agent_id='{id}' message='4' />\n                <LookAtRobot agent_id='{id}' />\n                <Sequence name='AvoidRobotSequence'>\n                    <IsRobotNearby agent_id='{id}' distance='2.0' />\n                    <AvoidRobot agent_id='{id}' time_step='{dt}' />\n                </Sequence>\n            </Sequence>\n            <!-- This part of the fallback tree is empty because doing nothing is the default action, which represents Human 1 standing in the group -->\n        </Fallback>\n    </BehaviorTree>\n</root>"}
