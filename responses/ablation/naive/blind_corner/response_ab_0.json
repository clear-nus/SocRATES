{"scenariodescription": "The robot, a delivery bot, is tasked with transporting a box from one side of the warehouse to the other. The scenario takes place in the central part of the warehouse. The robot starts from the east passageway (node e3) and needs to transport the box to the west passageway (node 11). As the robot takes a turn at a blind corner (node 99 to node d9), it encounters a human (Human 1). Human 1 does not notice the robot until it is very close (within 1.5 meters) and stops completely until the robot is no longer blocking their path. The robot then continues its journey to the destination.", "numberofhumans": 1, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is performing daily duties in the warehouse.

Given the rough scenario, the robot will encounter Human 1 at a blind corner where the human does not notice the robot until very close and stops completely until the robot clears the path. Human 1's behavior is modeled using a behavior tree that makes them stop when the robot is within 1.5 meters and not move until the path is clear. The robot's behavior tree includes nodes for regular navigation and interactions with the human, using 'PROCEED' and 'EXCUSE ME' commands appropriately. The robot first checks if it is blocking the human and, if so, gives a 'PROCEED' command and waits a little. If the human is not blocking, or after the 'PROCEED' gesture, it continues with its navigation."}
