{"scenariodescription": "The robot is a delivery bot in a small warehouse tasked with transporting a box from one point to another. The scene unfolds as the robot navigates through the Passageways. The robot starts at the east intersection near node e3, carrying the box to the west intersection at node 07. During its journey, the robot takes a turn at a blind corner formed by nodes 79 and 99, and immediately encounters Human 1. Human 1 only notices the robot when it is very close and stops completely until the robot is no longer blocking its path. The warehouse contains other employees busy with their daily duties.", "numberofhumans": 1, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 only sees the robot when it's very close (within 1 meter) and stops in its tracks until the robot moves past it."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot should navigate efficiently from the starting point to the destination while avoiding obstacles.

The robot's trajectory involves turning at a blind corner formed by nodes 79 and 99. When the human sees the robot within close proximity (~1 meter), Human 1 stops completely. The robot is expected to communicate effectively and navigate around the human when needed. For Human 1, the behavior tree includes checking if the robot is nearby using the IsRobotNearby condition. If the robot is within 1 meter, Human 1 will execute the AvoidRobot action and stop. If the robot is not nearby, Human 1 will continue with regular navigation activities using the RegularNavTree subtree."}
