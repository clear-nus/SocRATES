{"scenariodescription": "The robot is a delivery bot tasked with transporting a box from one point to another in a small warehouse. The robot starts from the north-east corner and must navigate to the south-west corner. As the robot takes a turn at a blind corner located at the intersection of nodes 'aa', '99', and '47', it immediately encounters a human. The human is initially unaware of the robot and continues to walk, only noticing the robot when it gets very close. Upon seeing the robot, the human stops completely until the robot is no longer blocking the way.", "numberofhumans": 1, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is walking through the warehouse, unaware of the robot.

Upon encountering Human 1 at the blind corner, the robot should adjust its path to clear the way for Human 1 by saying 'EXCUSE ME' and waiting for the human to move.

The robot starts from the north-east corner (c5) and navigates to the south-west corner (0e). Upon encountering Human 1 at the blind corner, the human stops completely until the robot is not blocking them anymore, ensuring safety and navigation are prioritised. Human 1's behavior is simulated through a sequence that checks the robot's proximity and stops when the robot is very close, while the robot's behavior involves careful navigation and communication with the human. Using nested sequences and fallback nodes in the behavior tree structure helps in orchestrating the interaction smoothly. This setup will reflect a realistic encounter between a delivery robot and a human worker, aiding in assessing the robot's social navigation capabilities."}
