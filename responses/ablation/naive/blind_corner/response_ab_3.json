{"scenariodescription": "The robot is a delivery bot tasked with transporting a box from the east side of the warehouse to the west side. The warehouse consists of passageways, intersections, and open areas designed for efficient navigation. The robot starts at the intersection near the open area to the east (node '79') and needs to transport the box to the intersection near the west side (node '07'). During the task, the robot takes a turn at a blind corner (node 'd9') and encounters an employee. The employee sees the robot only at the last moment and stops completely until the robot moves away, ensuring not to block the robot's path.", "numberofhumans": 1, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 notices the robot only when it is very close and then stops moving until the robot is no longer blocking its path."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot maintains its course and continues navigating towards its goal while ensuring not to collide with the human. Upon detecting the close proximity of the human, the robot politely says 'EXCUSE ME', moves around the human if needed, and continues its task once the human gives way.", "trajectories": {"ROBOT": ["79", "99", "d9", "f7", "07"], "HUMAN 1": ["aa", "d9"]}, "groupids": {"HUMAN 1": -1}, "tree": {"HUMAN 1": "<root main_tree_to_execute='HumanBehaviorTree'><BehaviorTree ID='HumanBehaviorTree'><Fallback name='MainFallback'><Sequence name='CloseProximityRobot'><IsRobotNearby agent_id='{id}' distance='1.0'/><RobotSays agent_id='{id}' message='4'/><AvoidRobot agent_id='{id}' time_step='{dt}'/></Sequence><Sequence name='RegularNavFallback'><SubTree ID='RegularNavTree'/></Sequence></Fallback></BehaviorTree></root>"}, "reasoning": "To design the scenario where the robot takes a turn at a blind corner and encounters a human employee, we need to map out the trajectories and behaviors of both the robot and the human. The robot starts from node '79' and needs to navigate through nodes '99', 'd9', and 'f7' to reach the destination at node '07'. The human starts from node 'aa' and moves towards node 'd9'. When the robot encounters the human at the blind corner (node 'd9'), the human will notice the robot at a very close range and stop completely until the robot is no longer blocking it. This ensures the human's safety and allows the robot to continue its task smoothly. The robot's behavior is designed to maintain its trajectory while recognizing the human's proximity. It says 'EXCUSE ME' to the human and then continues its path without blocking the human. The robot's ability to navigate around the human ensures efficient task completion while maintaining safety."}
