{"scenariodescription": "The robot, tasked with transporting a box, navigates through the warehouse. The scenario begins with the robot starting from the east Passageway, heading towards the west Passageway.

Human 1 stops completely until the robot is no longer blocking their path then continues their routine.", "numberofhumans": 1, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 sees the robot very late, immediately stops and waits for the robot to clear the path before continuing their task."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot is expected to navigate the warehouse efficiently while avoiding obstacles and ensuring clear paths for humans.

The robot must navigate from the east Passageway to the west Passageway, passing through nodes 79, 99, d9, and f7 before reaching the blind corner at node 07. The human starts by performing daily tasks along a route that leads them to the blind corner at node 07. Here, Human 1 encounters the robot only when it is very close, leading them to stop completely until the robot clears the path. The robot's behavior tree must consider its defined task of delivering the box while ensuring to avoid blocking pathways for humans. Human 1's behavior tree includes a sequence where the human recognizes the robot very late, stops, and waits until the robot is not blocking them before continuing their task, as specified in the rough scenario details. Upon detecting the robot nearby and in the way, the human transitions from waiting to their normal activity once the path is clear, ensuring collision-free navigation for both entities."}
