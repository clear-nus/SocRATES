{"scenariodescription": "The robot is transporting a box from the west Passageway (Node 11) to the east Open Area (Node e3) inside the small warehouse. While navigating through the warehouse, the robot encounters a group of three humans in an open area (Node 69). The robot needs to signal 'EXCUSE ME' for the humans to give way and move aside.

The robot will start at Node 11 and travel towards Node e3, passing through Nodes: 07, f7, d9, aa, 69, and 99. The humans will be in an open area (Node 69) and will check if the robot says 'EXCUSE ME' before giving way. If the robot says 'EXCUSE ME', the humans will move aside to Nodes closer to the edge (Nodes ba). The tree structure for each human involves checking the robot's visibility, if the robot says 'EXCUSE ME', and then giving way. If the robot does not say 'EXCUSE ME', the humans will continue standing in their original positions and look at the robot."}
