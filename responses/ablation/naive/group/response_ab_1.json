{"scenariodescription": "The robot is a delivery bot in a small warehouse transporting a box from one point to another.

The robot will start from node 11 and travel towards node e3 for the delivery task. The employees are positioned at node d9, forming a group that blocks the robot's path. All involved humans are part of the same group as they are standing together. The behavior trees designed for each human ensure that upon seeing the robot and hearing 'EXCUSE ME', they will give way until the robot is not close anymore. The robot needs to perform the gesture 'EXCUSE ME' and wait for the path to clear before proceeding."}
