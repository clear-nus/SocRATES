{"scenariodescription": "The robot is transporting a box from node 32 (south Passageway) to node 11 (north Passageway) in the small warehouse.

During its journey, it will encounter a group of three humans in an intersection. The humans are performing daily duties and have their group behavior governed by the robot's actions. The encounter location has to ensure that when the robot approaches and says 'EXCUSE ME,' each human in the group recognizes this signal and gives way to the robot. The sequence of the robot's path\u2014starting from node 32 and traveling through specific nodes before reaching the final node 11\u2014creates an efficient route. By structuring the behaviors and trajectories as such, the scenario replicates the nuances of a real warehouse situation, prioritizing both robot and human interactions. This leads to the design of behavior trees for each human where they consider the robot's presence and its communicated signal before deciding to give way or continue standing."}
