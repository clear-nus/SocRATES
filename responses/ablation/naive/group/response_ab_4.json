{"scenariodescription": "The robot is a delivery bot tasked with transporting a box from the northeast corner of the warehouse to the southwest corner. The warehouse consists of passageways, intersections, and open areas that facilitate efficient movement. While transporting the box, the robot encounters a group of 3 employees standing in the central intersection. The robot will need to navigate through the group and ensure it reaches the destination. The scenario starts with the robot at the northeast aisle and needs to guide the robot to the southwest aisle. The employees are grouped together at the central intersection.", "numberofhumans": 3, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is part of a group standing at the central intersection.

The robot should detect the group of humans, say 'EXCUSE ME' to request passage, and then wait for the humans to move aside before proceeding. The group of humans should check if the robot says 'EXCUSE ME'. If it does, they should give way to the robot until it is not close anymore. If the robot doesn't say 'EXCUSE ME', they should continue standing in the group. The behavior trees for each human implement this logic using the IsRobotVisible, RobotSays, GiveWaytoRobot, and BlockRobot nodes. The fallback behavior allows humans to return to regular navigation or standing, respectively, based on the robot's actions."}
