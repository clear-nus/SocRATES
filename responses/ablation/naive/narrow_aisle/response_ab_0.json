{"scenariodescription": "The robot is tasked with transporting a box from the East Passageway to the West Passageway in a small warehouse. The robot starts at node 79, which is a narrow aisle. Human 1 is standing at the opposite end of the aisle at node 48. The human stands in its position until the robot is not blocking the path. Once the robot moves away and is no longer blocking the human's path, the human starts moving towards its goal in the same aisle.", "numberofhumans": 1, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 stands still at node 48 until the robot is no longer blocking its path.

It should recognize when it's blocking the human's path and move to a position where it can say 'Proceed' to Human 1.

Human 1 is stationed at the opposite end of the aisle. To orchestrate this scenario programmatically, the trajectories for both the robot and the human must be defined clearly. The robot's trajectory starts at node 79 and proceeds through nodes 99, cf, ba, cb, and ending at 0e. For Human 1, the path begins at node 48 and winds through nodes 47, aa, 99, and eventually reaching 79. The human behavior must adapt based on whether the robot is blocking its path or not. A behavior tree is developed to represent the human's decision to stay put when the robot is blocking and to start walking once the robot says 'Proceed' and the path is clear. The reasoning here revolves around ensuring a seamless interaction between the robot's navigational task and the human's ability to move without obstruction, reflecting a realistic warehouse scenario."}
