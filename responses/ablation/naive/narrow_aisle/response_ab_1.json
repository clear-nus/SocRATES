{"scenariodescription": "The Robot is a delivery bot in a small warehouse. The environment consists of passageways, intersections, and open areas that facilitate efficient navigation and connectivity. The Robot's task is to transport a box from node 79 to node 11. The scenario starts inside a narrow aisle at node 79. There is a human standing at node 47, which is at the opposite end of the aisle. The human stands its position until the robot is not blocking the path. Once the robot is not blocking the human, the human starts moving towards its goal located at node 79.", "numberofhumans": 1, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 stands at position 47, waiting while the robot is in the narrow aisle. Once the robot is not blocking the path, Human 1 starts moving towards its goal located at node 79."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot navigates from node 79 to node 11, moving through the passageways and intersections while ensuring it does not block the path for the human. The robot should move efficiently, taking care to avoid any obstacles and allow Human 1 to proceed as soon as possible by clearing the narrow aisle.", "trajectories": {"ROBOT": ["79", "99", "aa", "d9", "f7", "07", "11"], "HUMAN 1": ["47", "79"], "HUMAN 2": [], "HUMAN 3": []}, "groupids": {"HUMAN 1": -1, "HUMAN 2": -1, "HUMAN 3": -1}, "tree": {"HUMAN 1": "<root main_tree_to_execute='HumanWaitAndMoveTree'>\n<BehaviorTree ID='HumanWaitAndMoveTree'>\n<Sequence name='WaitAndMoveSequence'>\n    <IsRobotBlocking agent_id='{id}' distance='0.5'/>\n    <Inverter>\n        <IsRobotBlocking agent_id='{id}' distance='0.5'/>\n    </Inverter>\n    <UpdateGoal agent_id='{id}'/>\n    <RegularNav agent_id='{id}' time_step='{dt}'/>\n</Sequence>\n</BehaviorTree>\n</root>"}, "reasoning": "For this scenario, it's necessary to ensure that the human waits until the robot is not blocking the path in the narrow aisle before proceeding to its goal. The robot needs to navigate efficiently from node 79 to node 11 without hindering the human's path. The tree for Human 1 implements the logic for waiting until the robot clears the path and then moving towards its goal. Using the IsRobotBlocking condition checks if the robot is obstructing the human's path. Once the path is clear, the Inverter node ensures the condition passes, and then the UpdateGoal and RegularNav actions allow the human to proceed to the goal. This orchestrates the desired behavior where the human moves only after the robot has cleared the narrow aisle."}
