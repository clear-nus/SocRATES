{"scenariodescription": "The robot starts inside a narrow aisle (Node 79) in a small warehouse.

Human 1 should start moving only when the robot is no longer obstructing them. The scenario begins with the robot at Node 79 and Human 1 at Node 99. The robot will navigate through the aisle and reach Node 69. Human 1 will stand still until the robot passes and reaches Node 69. Once the path is clear, Human 1 will proceed to their goal at Node aa. The behavior tree for Human 1 involves checking if the robot is blocking their path. If not, they will start navigating towards their goal, ensuring that their movement aligns with the robot's actions. This ensures a smooth coordination between the robot's task and Human 1's movement within the warehouse."}
