{"scenariodescription": "The robot is tasked with transporting a box from one point to another in a small warehouse. The scenario starts in a narrow aisle at node 79. There is a human standing at the opposite end of the aisle at node 99. The human will remain in its position until the robot starts moving. As soon as the robot is not blocking the human's path, the human will begin moving towards its goal at node c5. The robot needs to navigate through the aisle while ensuring it does not block the human's path.", "numberofhumans": 1, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 stands at node 99 and waits until the robot is not blocking the path.

A human is positioned at the opposite end of the aisle at node 99 and will only start moving once the robot begins its navigation and does not block the path. The robot will navigate from node 79 to node e3, ensuring it does not obstruct the human. The human waits until the path is clear and then moves toward node c5. The behavior tree for Human 1 includes a fallback structure where it waits if the robot is blocking the path, and once the robot has moved, it proceeds to its goal using regular navigation."}
