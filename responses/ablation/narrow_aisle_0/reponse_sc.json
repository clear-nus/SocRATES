{"scenariodescription": "The robot starts inside a narrow aisle (NODE 79) inside the small warehouse, intending to transport boxes. At the opposite end of the aisle stands an employee. The aisle is cluttered with racks on either side, making it difficult for both the robot and human to pass each other without cooperation. The employee remains standing at their position as long as the robot is blocking their path. Once the robot has moved out of the way, the employee continues their walk towards their designated goal within the aisle.", "numberofhumans": 1, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 waits at their position at the end of the aisle, checking if the path is clear. Once the robot has moved out of the way and is no longer blocking the path, Human 1 starts moving towards their goal in the aisle."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot detects the human standing at the opposite end of the aisle. It moves to an available space that allows the human to pass by, ensuring not to block the path. After the human starts moving towards their goal and exits the aisle, the robot continues its task of transporting the boxes through the aisle."}
