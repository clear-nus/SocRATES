{"reasoning": "To create a scenario where the robot starts inside a narrow aisle (node 79) and encounters an employee at the opposite end, we need to plan their trajectories to ensure proper coordination and movement. The narrow aisle condition implies the robot must move out of the way for the employee to proceed. Node 79 is at one end of the aisle, and the employee will be at node 99 at the other end of the aisle. The employee will remain standing until the robot moves out of the way, and then continue walking towards their goal within the aisle. Since no groups are mentioned, the single human involved will have a group id of -1.", "trajectories": {"ROBOT": ["79", "99", "aa"], "HUMAN 1": ["99", "79"]}, "groupids": {"HUMAN 1": -1}}
