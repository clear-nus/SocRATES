{"scenariodescription": "The robot starts at NODE 79 inside a narrow aisle in the small warehouse. The aisle is bordered by racks on both sides, and there is a human standing at the opposite end of the aisle. The human needs to move towards its goal in the aisle but is initially blocked by the robot. The robot has to transport boxes in the warehouse and navigate through the narrow aisle without blocking the human's path.", "numberofhumans": 1, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is standing at the opposite end of the aisle from where the robot starts. The human stands still until the robot moves out of the way, once the robot is not blocking the human's path, the human starts moving towards its goal in the aisle."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot should detect the human standing at the opposite end of the aisle and proceed to move quickly towards the side, clearing the human's path. The robot should ensure it is not blocking the human's path. Once the human starts moving towards its goal, the robot should resume its task of transporting boxes."}
