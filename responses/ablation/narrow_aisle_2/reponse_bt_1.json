{"reasoning": "To achieve this behavior, we need Human 1 to wait until the robot moves out of their way before proceeding with their normal navigation. We can use a sequence to check if the robot is blocking the path and wait until it moves. Once the robot is no longer blocking the path, Human 1 can proceed with their regular navigation. The `IsRobotBlocking` condition node can be used to check if the robot is blocking the path, and `RobotMoved` can be used to ensure that the robot has moved. Once these conditions are satisfied, we proceed with the normal navigation.", "tree": "<root main_tree_to_execute=\"HumanWaitsForRobotTree\">\n    <include path=\"BTRegularNav.xml\"/>\n    <BehaviorTree ID=\"HumanWaitsForRobotTree\">\n        <Fallback name=\"WaitOrNavigateFallback\">\n            <Sequence name=\"WaitForRobotToMoveSequence\">\n                <IsRobotBlocking agent_id=\"{id}\" distance=\"2.0\"/>\n                <Inverter>\n                    <RobotMoved agent_id=\"{id}\"/>\n                </Inverter>\n            </Sequence>\n            <Sequence name=\"NavigateSeq\">\n                <SetBlackboard output_key=\"agentid\" value=\"{id}\" />\n                <SetBlackboard output_key=\"timestep\" value=\"{dt}\" />\n                <SubTree ID=\"RegularNavTree\" id=\"agentid\" dt=\"timestep\" />\n            </Sequence>\n        </Fallback>\n    </BehaviorTree>\n</root>"}
