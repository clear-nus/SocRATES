{"reasoning": "To create the scenario where a robot starts inside a narrow aisle at node '79', transporting boxes to node '99' at the opposite end of the aisle, and a human is standing at node '99' waiting to reach node '79' once the robot clears the path, we need to define the trajectories of the robot and the human. The human's and robot's paths are straightforward as they need to traverse the aisle in opposite directions. The human waits until the robot exits the aisle before starting to move.", "trajectories": {"robot": ["79", "99"], "human 1": ["99", "79"]}, "groupids": {"human 1": -1}}
