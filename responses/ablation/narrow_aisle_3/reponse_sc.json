When the robot moves out of the way, Human 1 begins normal navigation towards their goal in the aisle."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot assesses the situation and, upon detecting the human blocking its path, it either moves to the side or finds another path to avoid blocking the human. Once the path is clear for Human 1, the robot proceeds to transport the box through the aisle."}
