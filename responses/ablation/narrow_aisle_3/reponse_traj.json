{"reasoning": "To simulate a scenario where the robot starts inside a narrow aisle (node 79) with a box to transport and a human is standing at the opposite end of the aisle, blocking the passage, we need to precisely define the movements of both the robot and the human. The human will remain stationary until the robot moves out of the aisle. Once the robot is out of the human's path, the human will start moving towards their goal through the same aisle. Since there are no groups mentioned, assign -1 to the human's group id.", "trajectories": {"ROBOT": ["79", "99", "aa", "d9"], "HUMAN 1": ["c5", "e3", "99", "79"]}, "groupids": {"HUMAN 1": -1}}
