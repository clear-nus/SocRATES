{"reasoning": "To implement the described behavior, we must use the `IsRobotBlocking` condition to check if Human 1's path is blocked by the robot. If the path is blocked, Human 1 waits in their initial position. Once the robot clears the aisle, they will proceed towards their goal, treating the robot as a normal obstacle. We also use the `RegularNav` subtree to handle normal navigation once the robot is no longer blocking the path.", "tree": "<root main_tree_to_execute='NavigateAisleTree'>\n    <include path='BTRegularNav.xml'/>\n    <BehaviorTree ID='NavigateAisleTree'>\n        <Fallback name='BlockOrNavigateFallback'>\n            <Sequence name='BlockingSequence'>\n                <IsRobotBlocking agent_id='{id}' distance='1.0'/>\n                <MakeGesture agent_id='{id}' message='1'/> <!-- Makes Human 1 Wait -->\n            </Sequence>\n            <Sequence name='NavigateSequence'>\n                <MakeGesture agent_id='{id}' message='0'/> <!-- Clear gesture -->\n                <SetBlackboard output_key='agentid' value='{id}'/>\n                <SetBlackboard output_key='timestep' value='{dt}'/>\n                <SubTree ID='RegularNavTree' id='agentid' dt='timestep'/> <!-- Use Regular Navigation Subtree -->\n            </Sequence>\n        </Fallback>\n    </BehaviorTree>\n</root>"}
