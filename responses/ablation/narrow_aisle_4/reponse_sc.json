{"scenariodescription": "The robot is inside a narrow aisle (NODE 79) in the small warehouse, transporting boxes. The aisle is narrow enough that only one entity can pass through at a time. Human 1 is standing at the opposite end of the aisle, waiting for the robot to move out of their way. Human 1's goal is to move through the aisle to collect items from the packaging area.", "numberofhumans": 1, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is initially standing at the opposite end of the narrow aisle from the robot. Human 1 checks if the robot is blocking their path. If the robot is blocking the path, Human 1 waits in their position. Once the robot clears the aisle and is not blocking their path anymore, Human 1 starts navigating towards their goal in the aisle, treating the robot as a normal obstacle if encountered again."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot waits for a few seconds (maximum 5 seconds) to see if Human 1 is going to move. If the human remains stationary, the robot proceeds to the end of the aisle and exits to another section, ensuring it is not in Human 1's way. Once the robot clears the aisle, it continues to transport the boxes to the specified destination."}
