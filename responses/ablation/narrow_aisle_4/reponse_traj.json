{"reasoning": "In this scenario, the robot is inside a narrow aisle at Node 79, transporting boxes. Human 1 is standing at the opposite end of the aisle, waiting for the robot to move out of their way. Human 1's goal is to move through the aisle to collect items from the packaging area. The robot needs to move from Node 79 to Node 99 to clear the aisle. Once the robot has cleared the aisle, Human 1 will move from Node 99 through Node 79 to Node cf, which is closer to the packaging area.", "trajectories": {"ROBOT": ["79", "99"], "HUMAN 1": ["99", "79", "99", "cf"]}, "groupids": {"HUMAN 1": -1}}
