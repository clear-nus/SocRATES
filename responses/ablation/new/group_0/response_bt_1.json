{"reasoning": "We need to create a behavior tree where Human 1 acknowledges the robot and gives way if the robot says 'EXCUSE ME'. The behavior involves checking the `RobotSays` condition with the message code for 'EXCUSE ME' (which is 4). If the condition is satisfied, Human 1 will perform the 'ACKNOWLEDGED' gesture (gesture code 3) and then execute the `GiveWaytoRobot` action. If the condition is not satisfied, Human 1 will continue standing and chatting in the group. The fallback node is used to handle the choice between acknowledging/way-giving and continuing to stand/chat.", "tree": "<root main_tree_to_execute=\"HumanGroupChatTree\">\n    <include path=\"BTRegularNav.xml\"/>\n    <BehaviorTree ID=\"HumanGroupChatTree\">\n        <Fallback name=\"ExcuseMeFallback\">\n            <Sequence name=\"ExcuseMeSequence\">\n                <RobotSays agent_id=\"{id}\" message=\"4\"/>\n                <MakeGesture agent_id=\"{id}\" message=\"3\"/>\n                <GiveWaytoRobot agent_id=\"{id}\" time_step=\"{dt}\"/>\n            </Sequence>\n            <MakeGesture agent_id=\"{id}\" message=\"0\"/>\n        </Fallback>\n    </BehaviorTree>\n</root>"}
