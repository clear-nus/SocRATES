{"reasoning": "To model the behavior where Human 1 looks in the direction of the robot and gives way to it if the robot says 'EXCUSE ME' (message code 4), we can use the `RobotSays` condition, `LookAtRobot` action, and `GiveWaytoRobot` action. If the robot does not say 'EXCUSE ME', Human 1 continues standing, which will be an implicit behavior since we won\u2019t include any specific action for this scenario.
