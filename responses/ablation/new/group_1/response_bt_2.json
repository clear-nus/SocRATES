{"reasoning": "To achieve this behavior, we need to create a fallback structure that handles two cases: If the robot says 'EXCUSE ME' (gesture code 3), Human 2 should look in the direction of the robot and give way to the robot. If the robot does not say 'EXCUSE ME', Human 2 should stay put and continue the conversation. This behavior tree will consist of one `Fallback` node with two sequences. The first sequence checks if the robot says 'EXCUSE ME' and, if so, makes Human 2 look at the robot and give way to it. The second sequence covers the default behavior (i.e., staying put).", "tree": "<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>\n<root main_tree_to_execute='HumanGivesWayTree'>\n    <BehaviorTree ID='HumanGivesWayTree'>\n        <Fallback name='GiveWayFallback'>\n            <Sequence name='ExcuseMeSequence'>\n                <RobotSays agent_id='{id}' message='3'/>\n                <LookAtRobot agent_id='{id}' />\n                <GiveWaytoRobot agent_id='{id}' time_step='{dt}' />\n            </Sequence>\n            <Sequence name='StayPutSequence'>\n                <!-- We can use a NO-OP action to indicate staying put, as no continue conversation action is available -->\n                <MakeGesture agent_id='{id}' message='0'/>\n            </Sequence>\n        </Fallback>\n    </BehaviorTree>\n</root>"}
