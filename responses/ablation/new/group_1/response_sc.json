{"scenariodescription": "The robot is transporting a box from one end of the warehouse to the other, moving through the Passageways and navigating around various racks and open packaging areas. Along the way, the robot encounters a group of three employees standing and talking at an intersection in the Passageway.", "numberofhumans": 3, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "If the robot says 'EXCUSE ME', Human 1 looks in the direction of the robot and gives way to the robot until it passes. If the robot does not say 'EXCUSE ME', Human 1 continues to stand and talk with the group.", "Human 2": "If the robot says 'EXCUSE ME', Human 2 looks in the direction of the robot and gives way to the robot with the group until it passes. If the robot does not say 'EXCUSE ME', Human 2 stays put and continues the conversation.", "Human 3": "If the robot says 'EXCUSE ME', Human 3 also looks in the direction of the robot and gives way to the robot, aligning with the rest of the group\u2019s behavior. If the robot does not say 'EXCUSE ME', Human 3 remains standing and engaged in the conversation."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "When approaching the group of three employees, the robot should say 'EXCUSE ME'. The robot waits for the group to give way and continues on its path once the passage is clear. If the robot does not say 'EXCUSE ME', it remains stationary at a safe distance until the humans notice it."}
