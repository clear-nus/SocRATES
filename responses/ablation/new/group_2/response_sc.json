{"scenariodescription": "The robot is transporting a box from the packaging area to a rack section. While moving through a passageway, the robot encounters a group of 3 employees standing at an intersection, having a discussion. The robot needs to pass through the intersection to reach its destination.", "numberofhumans": 3, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is part of the group discussing work-related matters. If Human 1 hears the robot saying 'EXCUSE ME', they will move aside to give way to the robot. If the robot doesn't say 'EXCUSE ME', Human 1 continues standing in the group.", "Human 2": "Human 2 is also part of the group at the intersection. Similar to Human 1, Human 2 will give way to the robot if it hears 'EXCUSE ME'. Otherwise, Human 2 remains in the group.", "Human 3": "Human 3, being part of the same group, follows the same behavior. If the robot says 'EXCUSE ME', Human 3 gives way. If not, they stand in the group."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "Upon approaching the group of humans at the intersection, the robot should say 'EXCUSE ME'. If the group gives way to it, the robot should proceed through the intersection. If the group does not give way, the robot should stop and wait for a few seconds, then attempt to say 'EXCUSE ME' again until the path is clear."}
