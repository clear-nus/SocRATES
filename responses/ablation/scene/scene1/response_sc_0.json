{"scenariodescription": "The robot is tasked with transporting boxes from the packaging area to a storage rack. The robot starts in the packaging area and needs to navigate through a passageway that intersects with another passageway to reach the storage rack. Two employees are working in the warehouse: one near the intersection and another near the storage rack.", "numberofhumans": 2, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is near the intersection, performing regular navigation duties. If the robot is visible and moving towards the intersection, Human 1 looks in the direction of the robot and gives way to the robot.", "Human 2": "Human 2 is near the storage rack, focused on organizing items. If the robot is visible and is saying any particular phrase, Human 2 continues their task, treating the robot as a normal obstacle."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot should navigate the passageway, avoid blocking Human 1, and reach the storage rack. It should use phrases like 'EXCUSE ME' if any human is in its path. The robot should acknowledge any human if they say 'PROCEED' or 'WAIT' by saying 'ACKNOWLEDGED.'"}
