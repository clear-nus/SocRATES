{"scenariodescription": "The robot is tasked with transporting boxes from the packaging area at the north side of the warehouse to a rack at the south side. As the robot navigates through a passageway, it encounters two employees at an intersection. The passageway has racks on both sides, limiting the maneuvering space.", "numberofhumans": 2, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is walking from the east passageway to the west passageway. Upon seeing the robot, Human 1 stops and gives way to the robot.", "Human 2": "Human 2 is walking from the west passageway to the east passageway. Human 2 does not notice the robot initially and only realizes its presence when very close. Human 2 then says 'EXCUSE ME' and navigates around the robot treating it as a normal obstacle."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot should stop upon seeing Human 1 stopping and acknowledge by saying 'ACKNOWLEDGED'. It should wait until Human 1 has fully cleared its path. When Human 2 comes close and says 'EXCUSE ME', the robot should stop and say 'PROCEED', waiting for Human 2 to navigate around it before continuing its task towards the south side rack."}
