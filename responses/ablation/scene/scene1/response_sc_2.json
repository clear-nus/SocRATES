{"scenariodescription": "The robot is transporting boxes from the racks in the warehouse to the open packaging area. It needs to pass through several passageways and intersections. Two employees are navigating the warehouse to perform their daily duties, which include picking items from the racks and moving them to other areas.", "numberofhumans": 2, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is moving from the entrance of the warehouse to the packaging area. When the human sees the robot, they treat it as a normal obstacle and adjust their path to avoid collision.", "Human 2": "Human 2 is moving from the packaging area to the racks. If the robot is visible, Human 2 looks in the direction of the robot and gestures for it to proceed when near an intersection. After gesturing, Human 2 waits for a confirmation phrase from the robot before continuing with their path."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot should adjust its speed to avoid collisions with the humans. If Human 2 gestures for the robot to proceed, the robot should say 'ACKNOWLEDGED' and continue its path when safe to do so. The robot should navigate through the passageways and intersections without causing any disturbances to the human workflows."}
