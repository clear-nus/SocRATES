{"scenariodescription": "The robot is transporting boxes from the packaging area to the storage racks. The robot moves through a passageway and reaches an intersection where it encounters two employees. The first employee is walking towards the packaging area while the second employee is moving boxes from one rack to another near the intersection.", "numberofhumans": 2, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is navigating towards the packaging area through the intersection. When the robot is visible, Human 1 glances at the robot and continues normal navigation. If the robot blocks the path, Human 1 says 'WAIT' and makes a gesture to the robot to proceed, then waits for the robot to clear the path.", "Human 2": "Human 2 is moving boxes from one rack to another near the intersection. When the robot is visible and nearby, Human 2 gives way to the robot to avoid collision. Human 2 treats the robot as a normal obstacle and quickly resumes work after the robot moves past."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot should initially slow down when it detects Human 1 moving towards the packaging area. If Human 1 says 'WAIT', the robot responds with 'ACKNOWLEDGED' and stops temporarily until Human 1 allows it to proceed. After receiving the gesture to proceed, the robot continues to transport boxes towards the storage racks but slows down again if it detects Human 2 moving boxes, allowing Human 2 to give way. Once the path is clear, the robot resumes its normal speed to complete the transport task."}
