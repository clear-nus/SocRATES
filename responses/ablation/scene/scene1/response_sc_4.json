{"scenariodescription": "The robot is transporting boxes from one packaging area to another. As it moves through a passageway, it encounters two employees at an intersection. Human 1 is coming from a different passageway and Human 2 is moving towards one of the racks from the intersection.", "numberofhumans": 2, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is focused on getting to their destination and does not initially notice the robot. Upon noticing the robot close by, Human 1 stops and gestures for the robot to proceed.", "Human 2": "Human 2 notices the robot immediately and steps aside to give way for the robot to pass. If the robot takes too long, Human 2 says 'EXCUSE ME' and waits for 5 seconds before proceeding."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot should wait for Human 1's gesture to proceed before moving forward. When Human 2 stands aside, it should say 'ACKNOWLEDGED' and continue its path towards the packaging area. If Human 2 says 'EXCUSE ME,' the robot should pause and let Human 2 pass before resuming its task."}
