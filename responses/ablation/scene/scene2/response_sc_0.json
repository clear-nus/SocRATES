{"scenariodescription": "The robot is navigating through a passageway in the warehouse to guide humans to safety after a disaster has occurred. Along the way, it encounters two humans in different areas of the warehouse. Human 1 is near an open packaging area and is looking for a safe exit. Human 2 is located at an intersection in the passageways and seems to be checking the surroundings for safety.", "numberofhumans": 2, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 sees the robot and follows it, as they recognize it as an emergency response guide. Human 1 continuously looks in the direction of the robot and navigates closely behind it.", "Human 2": "Human 2 spots the robot at the intersection and decides to move quickly towards the front of the robot to block its path. Human 2 assumes responsibility to ensure the path ahead is safe, then gives way to the robot while guiding them towards a safe exit."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot announces 'FOLLOW ME' to Human 1 to encourage them to follow. Upon reaching the intersection and noticing Human 2 blocking its path, the robot should say 'ACKNOWLEDGED' and wait for Human 2 to give way before proceeding. The robot continuously checks if both humans are safely following as it navigates towards the exit."}
