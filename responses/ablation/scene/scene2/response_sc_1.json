Human 2 is in the open packaging area, looking disoriented. The safety exit is at the southern end of a passageway intersecting with others.", "numberofhumans": 2, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is initially focused on gathering belongings and does not notice the robot. Once the robot says 'PROCEED TO SAFETY', Human 1 acknowledges and starts normal navigation towards the exit.", "Human 2": "Human 2 is disoriented and does not notice the robot at first. Upon robot repeating 'FOLLOW ME' three times, Human 2 looks in the direction of the robot and starts following it towards the exit."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot announces 'PROCEED TO SAFETY' when near Human 1, waits for Human 1 to acknowledge and start moving.
