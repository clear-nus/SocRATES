{"scenariodescription": "The emergency response robot is navigating through a small warehouse in a disaster situation. The warehouse consists of various racks and open packaging areas connected by passageways. These passageways also create intersections. The robot starts at the entrance of a passageway and needs to guide humans to a safety exit located at the far end of the warehouse. Human 1 is located in an open packaging area near an intersection, and Human 2 is located at a different intersection within the passageway.", "numberofhumans": 2, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 sees the robot and looks in its direction. When Human 1 hears the robot say 'FOLLOW ME', they follow the robot and navigate towards the safety exit. If the robot stops or encounters an obstacle, Human 1 waits for the robot to proceed.", "Human 2": "Human 2 is initially facing away from the passageway and doesn't notice the robot until it speaks. Once the robot says 'FOLLOW ME', Human 2 turns to look at the robot and then starts to follow it. If Human 2 encounters an obstacle or sees the robot stop, they wait for the robot to proceed."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot should navigate towards Human 1 and say 'FOLLOW ME'. Once Human 1 starts following, it should guide them through the intersection and passageways towards the safety exit. On encountering Human 2, the robot should repeat the 'FOLLOW ME' command, ensuring both humans are following it towards the exit. Throughout the scenario, the robot should avoid obstacles and ensure a clear path for the humans."}
