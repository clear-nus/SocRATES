{"scenariodescription": "The emergency response robot is guiding three workers to safety through a small warehouse. The warehouse is filled with racks and open packaging areas, connected by passageways and intersections. The robot starts at the eastern entrance of the warehouse and needs to guide the humans through various passageways to the western exit, which leads to the safety zone. The robot must also navigate around fallen debris and ensure humans follow it safely.", "numberofhumans": 3, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is initially panicked and avoids the robot. Upon seeing the robot, they become reassured and start to follow it.", "Human 2": "Human 2 is calm and navigates normally, treating the robot as a guide to safety. They will follow the robot's instructions without hesitation.", "Human 3": "Human 3 is confused and keeps looking at the robot for direction. They occasionally get distracted by the debris and need to be reassured by the robot."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot should guide the humans through the safest route, avoiding fallen debris and obstacles. It should frequently check if all humans are following by saying 'PROCEED' and 'WAIT' as necessary. The robot should provide reassurance by saying 'ACKNOWLEDGED' when Human 1 shows signs of panic and 'PROCEED' when Human 3 is distracted. The robot should move steadily and predictably to maintain a smooth and safe evacuation."}
