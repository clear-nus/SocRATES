{"scenariodescription": "The robot starts in one of the research labs on the 4th floor, tasked with delivering coffee to a meeting room at the far end of the office floor and then returning to the initial research lab. The floor consists of a series of research labs and meeting rooms connected by narrow passageways, intersections, and a few blind corners. The robot first encounters Human 1 walking toward it in a narrow passageway. Later, it meets Human 1 again at an intersection where both need to decide who moves first. Finally, the robot encounters Human 1 at a blind corner where they almost collide.", "numberofhumans": 1, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is a pedestrian walking in a closed circuit path. In the narrow passageway, Human 1 asks the robot to wait and then navigates past the robot. At the intersection, Human 1 makes eye contact with the robot and gestures for it to proceed. At the blind corner, Human 1 is startled, moves quickly to block the robot's path, then steps back and gestures to the robot, saying 'PROCEED'."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot waits for Human 1 to pass in the narrow passageway. At the intersection, the robot acknowledges Human 1's gesture with 'ACKNOWLEDGED' and proceeds. At the blind corner, the robot stops immediately and waits for Human 1 to step back and gesture 'PROCEED' before moving forward."}
