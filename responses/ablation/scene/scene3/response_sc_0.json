{"scenariodescription": "The robot is tasked with cleaning the warehouse. It starts in an open packaging area and moves toward one of the passageways to clean the floor. As it moves, it encounters two warehouse workers at different intersections: one worker is transporting items using a trolley toward the open packaging area, while the other worker is walking through the passageway, heading toward the racks.", "numberofhumans": 2, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is transporting items using a trolley from one rack to the open packaging area. If Human 1 sees the robot in the passageway, they ask the robot to wait by saying 'WAIT' and then proceed to move the trolley past the robot before continuing on their path. Human 1 will then ignore the robot once past.", "Human 2": "Human 2 is walking through the passageway toward the racks. If Human 2 sees the robot, they say 'EXCUSE ME' and wait for the robot to either stop or move aside. Once the passageway is clear, Human 2 resumes normal navigation to their goal."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot should wait when Human 1 says 'WAIT'. It resumes cleaning once Human 1 has moved the trolley past. When Human 2 says 'EXCUSE ME', the robot should either stop if it's moving or move aside if it's stationary. The robot should ensure the passageway is clear before resuming its cleaning task in the passageway."}
