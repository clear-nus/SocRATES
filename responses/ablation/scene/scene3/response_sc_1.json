{"scenariodescription": "The robot is attempting to deliver coffee from the kitchen located at one end of the 4th floor to a meeting room located at the opposite end. While moving through a passageway, it encounters an employee (Human 1) who is heading towards a research lab from the opposite direction. Shortly after that, at an intersection near the meeting room, the robot encounters a service worker (Human 2), who is carrying supplies towards the coffee room.", "numberofhumans": 2, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": {"behavior": "Human 1 is walking towards a research lab from the opposite direction. Upon seeing the robot, Human 1 performs normal navigation and treats the robot as a normal obstacle, but gives way to the robot if the robot is blocking their path."}, "Human 2": {"behavior": "Human 2 is heading towards the coffee room with supplies. Upon noticing the robot, Human 2 asks 'EXCUSE ME' if the robot is in the way and waits for the robot to clear the path. If the robot is not obstructing, Human 2 proceeds without interacting."}}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot, while navigating through the passageway, will ensure it checks if it is blocking Human 1's path and says 'PROCEED' if Human 1 is blocked. At the intersection, upon hearing 'EXCUSE ME' from Human 2, the robot will say 'PROCEED' and adjust its trajectory to clear the way before continuing towards the meeting room."}
