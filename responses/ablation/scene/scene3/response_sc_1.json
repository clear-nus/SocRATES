Human 1 then waits for the robot to acknowledge and give way before proceeding.", "Human 2": "Human 2 is moving quickly from rack section B to the open packaging area and does not notice the robot initially. Upon seeing Human 1 interacting with the robot, Human 2 slows down and waits behind Human 1."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot acknowledges Human 1 by saying 'ACKNOWLEDGED', stops its cleaning operation, and moves aside to give way to Human 1 and Human 2.
