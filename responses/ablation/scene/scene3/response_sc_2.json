{"scenariodescription": "The robot is cleaning an open packaging area in the warehouse. Human 1 is organizing boxes on a shelf in the corner of the same area, while Human 2 is walking from one end of the packaging area to the other, through the intersection. Human 2 crosses paths with the robot multiple times as it cleans.", "numberofhumans": 2, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 occasionally looks towards the robot but largely ignores it and continues organizing boxes. If the robot comes too close, Human 1 gives way to the robot and then resumes organizing.", "Human 2": "Human 2 regularly crosses paths with the robot. When the robot is visible, Human 2 says 'EXCUSE ME' and continues normal navigation, treating the robot as an obstacle. If the robot blocks Human 2's path, Human 2 says 'WAIT' and waits for the robot to move before continuing."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot should navigate around the humans while cleaning. If Human 2 says 'EXCUSE ME', the robot should momentarily slow down and give way. If Human 2 says 'WAIT', the robot should stop immediately and say 'ACKNOWLEDGED' before moving out of Human 2's path."}
