{"scenariodescription": "The robot is delivering coffee from the coffee room to a research lab. The route takes the robot through a passageway with a blind corner, which leads to an intersection connecting various labs and meeting rooms. As the robot approaches the blind corner, it encounters two employees coming from opposite directions. Human 1 is heading towards the meeting room from a different lab, and Human 2 is walking from the staff area towards the coffee room.", "numberofhumans": 2, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is walking towards the meeting room, sees the robot approaching the blind corner, and stops to let the robot pass, saying 'PROCEED'. Once the robot passes, Human 1 continues walking towards their destination.", "Human 2": "Human 2 is coming from the staff area and does not notice the robot initially. As Human 2 gets closer, they see the robot, stop for a moment, and then navigate around the robot to continue to the coffee room."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "Upon detecting the blind corner, the robot slows down and says 'EXCUSE ME' to alert any nearby humans. When Human 1 says 'PROCEED', the robot acknowledges with 'ACKNOWLEDGED' and moves past the blind corner. After passing the corner, it detects Human 2 navigating around, waits momentarily, and then continues towards the research lab."}
