{"scenariodescription": "The robot is tasked with delivering coffee from the coffee room on the 4th floor to a meeting room at the end of a passageway. The robot starts at one end of the passageway and needs to navigate through a blind corner before reaching the meeting room. Human 1, an employee, is walking from a research lab towards the coffee room. Human 2, another employee, is emerging from a meeting room and heading towards the research lab. Both humans will intersect with the robot at different points in the passageway.", "numberofhumans": 2, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is walking leisurely towards the coffee room and stops to let the robot pass after noticing it.", "Human 2": "Human 2 is in a hurry to get to the research lab and gets frustrated when blocked by the robot, eventually asking the robot to let them pass with 'EXCUSE ME'."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot should slow down at the blind corner, say 'I AM HERE' to alert any nearby humans, and proceed cautiously. Upon encountering Human 1, the robot should continue its path as Human 1 gives way. When Human 2 asks 'EXCUSE ME', the robot should stop and move aside, saying 'PROCEED' to let Human 2 pass before continuing to the meeting room to deliver the coffee."}
