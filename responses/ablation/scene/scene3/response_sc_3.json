{"scenariodescription": "The robot is tasked with cleaning the warehouse and starts by moving from the central Passageway to the eastern end where there is an open packaging area. There are racks on either side of the passageway. As the robot moves along the passageway, it encounters a worker who is inspecting the racks and occasionally crossing the passageway to pick items from opposite shelves. The robot must navigate around the worker while continuing its cleaning task.", "numberofhumans": 2, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is inspecting items on the racks along the passageway and occasionally crossing the passageway to pick items from the opposite shelves. When the robot is visible, Human 1 glances at the robot but continues with their task. If the robot is blocking the path, Human 1 waits briefly and says 'EXCUSE ME' before continuing to the other side.", "Human 2": "Human 2 is at the open packaging area at the eastern end of the warehouse, packaging items. They do not notice the robot unless it enters their immediate vicinity. If the robot comes close, Human 2 steps aside to give way to the robot without any verbal communication."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot should avoid blocking Human 1's path by stopping and saying 'ACKNOWLEDGED' when it hears 'EXCUSE ME', then move aside to let Human 1 pass. In the open packaging area, the robot should slow down if Human 2 is in its immediate vicinity and resume cleaning once Human 2 steps aside."}
