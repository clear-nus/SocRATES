{"scenariodescription": "The robot is tasked with delivering coffee from the coffee room on the 4th floor to a research lab. The robot starts in the coffee room and must navigate through a passageway, turn left at an intersection, and then proceed straight ahead to reach the research lab. At the intersection, the robot encounters an employee walking towards the coffee room, and a service worker coming from the opposite direction towards the passageway.", "numberofhumans": 2, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is an employee walking towards the coffee room from the opposite direction of the robot. If the robot is visible, Human 1 looks at the robot and says 'WAIT' if the robot is moving towards them. They then continue navigating towards their goal once the robot stops.", "Human 2": "Human 2 is a service worker coming from the opposite direction towards the passageway. If the robot is currently moving, Human 2 makes a gesture towards the robot to signal it to proceed and waits for it to move. After the robot proceeds, Human 2 continues navigating towards their goal."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot should acknowledge Human 1 by saying 'ACKNOWLEDGED' and then stop until Human 1 has crossed its path. After Human 1 has cleared the intersection, the robot should proceed and encounter Human 2. The robot should wait for the gesture from Human 2 and then say 'PROCEED' before continuing towards the research lab."}
