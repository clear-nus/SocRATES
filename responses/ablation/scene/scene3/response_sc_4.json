{"scenariodescription": "The robot is cleaning the Passageways within the warehouse. It starts from an open packaging area and moves towards an intersection. At the intersection, two warehouse workers enter from different directions, both heading towards the open packaging area. The intersection is relatively narrow, making it challenging for the robot and the humans to pass simultaneously.", "numberofhumans": 2, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 enters the intersection from passageway A. If Human 1 sees the robot at the intersection and the robot is currently moving, Human 1 says 'WAIT' and waits for the robot to stop before proceeding. Otherwise, Human 1 continues navigating normally to the packaging area.", "Human 2": "Human 2 enters the intersection from passageway B. Human 2 does not notice the robot and continues navigating normally towards the packaging area, treating the robot as a normal obstacle."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot stops when it hears a human say 'WAIT' and says 'ACKNOWLEDGED'. It waits for both humans to clear the intersection before resuming its cleaning task and continuing to passageway."}
