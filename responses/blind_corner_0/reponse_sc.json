{"scenariodescription": "The robot is transporting boxes from one rack to another through a passageway in the warehouse. The location where the encounter happens is at a blind corner of the passageway near the intersection with another passageway. The human employee is walking towards the intersection from the other passageway and the robot makes a turn at the blind corner, encountering the human immediately. The human only sees the robot when it is very close, and stops completely until the robot is not blocking their path anymore.", "numberofhumans": 1, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is walking towards the intersection and encounters the robot suddenly at the blind corner. Upon seeing the robot very close by, Human 1 stops completely until the robot clears its path."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot should immediately stop upon encountering Human 1, say 'ACKNOWLEDGED' to the human, and wait for Human 1 to decide next move. If Human 1 stops, the robot should proceed carefully until it is not blocking the human's path anymore and then continue its task of transporting boxes."}
