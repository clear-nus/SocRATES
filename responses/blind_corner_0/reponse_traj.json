{"reasoning": "In this scenario, the robot is transporting boxes from one rack to another through a passageway in the warehouse. The robot encounters a human employee at a blind corner near the intersection with another passageway. We need to identify suitable nodes and plan the trajectories for both the robot and the human. The chosen setup will allow the robot to meet the employee at a blind corner intersection. The human will stop completely until the robot moves past the intersection.", "trajectories": {"ROBOT": ["f7", "d9", "aa"], "HUMAN 1": ["79", "99", "aa"]}, "groupids": {"HUMAN 1": -1}}
