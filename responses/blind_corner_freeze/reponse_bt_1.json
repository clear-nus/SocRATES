{"reasoning": "To create a behavior tree where the human stops completely upon seeing the robot very close and waits until the robot is not blocking its path anymore before proceeding, we need to use `IsRobotBlocking` as the condition to check if the robot is blocking the path. If the robot is blocking, the human will wait (i.e., no action is taken). Once the robot is not blocking, the human will proceed towards their goal using regular navigation (`RegularNavTree`). The behavior tree should use a fallback node that first checks if the robot is blocking and only proceeds to regular navigation if the robot is not blocking.", "tree": "<root main_tree_to_execute=\"StopAndWaitTree\"> \n<include path=\"BTRegularNav.xml\"/>\n<BehaviorTree ID=\"StopAndWaitTree\">\n<Fallback name=\"StopAndWaitFallback\">\n<Sequence name=\"StopSequence\">\n<IsRobotBlocking agent_id=\"{id}\" distance=\"2.0\"/>\n</Sequence>\n<Sequence name=\"RegNav\">\n<SetBlackboard output_key=\"agentid\" value=\"{id}\"/>\n<SetBlackboard output_key=\"timestep\" value=\"{dt}\"/>\n<SubTree ID=\"RegularNavTree\" id=\"agentid\" dt=\"timestep\"/>\n</Sequence>\n</Fallback>\n</BehaviorTree>\n</root>"}
