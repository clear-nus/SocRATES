{"reasoning": "To create the scenario where the robot is transporting boxes through a Small Warehouse, moves through a Passageway, takes a turn at a blind corner near an intersection, and encounters an employee walking and performing daily warehouse duties, we need to carefully plan the robot's trajectory and identify a suitable intersection and blind corner for the encounter. Based on the warehouse layout, we can orchestrate the following scenario: \n\n1. The robot starts at an AISLE node and moves through a Passageway to an intersection. 2. The robot turns at a blind corner near the intersection. 3. The robot encounters an employee walking from another direction. 4. The employee stops to let the robot pass and then continues with their task.\n\n### Selected Nodes:\n1. Starting AISLE: Node \"11\"\n2. Blind Corner: Node \"07\"\n3. Intersection: Node \"f7\"\n\n### Robot's Trajectory:\n1. Start at node \"11\" (AISLE). 2. Move to node \"07\" (blind corner near INTERSECTION). 3. Turn and move to node \"f7\" (INTERSECTION).\n\n### Employee's Trajectory:\n1. Start at node \"f7\". 2. Move to node \"07\" (blind corner) and stop upon encountering the robot.\n\n### Detailed Node Sequence for the Robot:\n1. 11 2. 07 3. f7\n\n### Detailed Node Sequence for the Employee:\n1. f7 2. 07\n\n### Simulator Initialization:\n1. **Robot**: Starts at node \"11\" with boxes. Follows the path: 11 \u2192 07 \u2192 f7. 2. **Employee**: Starts at node \"f7\" and moves towards node \"07\". Stops when encountering the robot.\n\n### Steps to Simulate:\n1. Initialize the robot at node \"11\" with boxes. 2. Set the robot to move along the path 11 \u2192 07 \u2192 f7. 3. Initialize the employee at node \"f7\" and set their trajectory to move towards node \"07\". 4. The employee stops at node \"07\" upon encountering the robot and resumes walking after the robot passes.\n\nThis setup ensures that the robot, while navigating through the warehouse, encounters an employee near a blind corner and the employee stops to let the robot pass before continuing with their task.", "trajectories": {"ROBOT": ["11", "07", "f7"], "HUMAN 1": ["f7", "07"]}, "groupids": {"HUMAN 1": -1}}
