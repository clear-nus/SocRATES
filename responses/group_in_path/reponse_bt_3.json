{"reasoning": "The human (Human 3) should give way to the robot if the robot says 'EXCUSE ME' (gesture code 4) and is close (let's consider close as within a distance of 1.0 meter). If these conditions are not met, Human 3 will continue standing. Consequently, we will use the following nodes: `RobotSays` to check if the robot says 'EXCUSE ME', `IsRobotNearby` to check the robot's proximity, `GiveWaytoRobot` to perform the action of giving way, and a fallback node to handle the case of continuing to stand.", "tree": "<root main_tree_to_execute='Human3BehaviorTree'>\n    <BehaviorTree ID='Human3BehaviorTree'>\n        <Fallback name='CheckAndGiveWay'>\n            <Sequence name='GiveWaySequence'>\n                <RobotSays agent_id='{id}' message='4'/>\n                <IsRobotNearby agent_id='{id}' distance='1.0'/>\n                <GiveWaytoRobot agent_id='{id}' t='{dt}'/>\n            </Sequence>\n            <MakeGesture agent_id='{id}' message='0'/>\n        </Fallback>\n    </BehaviorTree>\n</root>"}
