{"Scenario Description": "The robot is navigating from Aisle1 (1) to Aisle7 (7) to perform an inventory check. An employee is walking from Aisle6 (6) to Hall (5) and crosses paths with the robot at the intersection Aisle2 (2).", "Number of Humans": 1, "Trajectories": {"Robot": "Aisle1 (1) -> Hall (5) -> Aisle7 (7)", "Human 1": "Aisle6 (6) -> Hall (5)"}, "Behaviors": {"Human 1": "Employee moves swiftly through the intersection but acknowledges the presence of the robot by making brief eye contact."}, "Expected Robot Behavior": "The robot waits at the intersection Aisle2 (2) and says 'MAKE WAY' to the employee. Once the employee has passed, the robot proceeds to Aisle7 (7) at a steady pace.", "Principle Ranking": "Safety (P1) > Politeness (P4) > Task Efficiency (P8) > Social Competency (P5) > Legibility (P3) > Comfort (P2) > Understanding Other Agents (P6) > Proactivity (P7)", "Reasoning": "This scenario tests the robot's ability to interact with employees in a busy warehouse environment where quick movements and awareness are crucial. Prioritizing Safety and Politeness ensures smooth navigation and minimal disruption to the employees' tasks."}
