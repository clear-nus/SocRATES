{"Scenario Description": "The robot is tasked with navigating to a specific rack in Aisle3 (3) to perform an inventory check. An employee is present in Aisle2 (2) moving towards the intersection at Aisle3 (3).", "Number of Humans": 1, "Trajectories": {"Robot": "Aisle1 (1) -> Hall (5) -> Aisle3 (3)", "Human 1": "Aisle2 (2) -> Aisle3 (3)"}, "Behaviors": {"Human 1": "Employee is focused on their task and will proceed to Aisle3 (3) to complete their work without much interaction with the robot."}, "Expected Robot Behavior": "The robot recognizes the employee approaching the intersection at Aisle3 (3) and waits at the entrance of Aisle3 (3) until the employee passes. Once the employee has crossed, the robot proceeds to the specific rack.", "Principle Ranking": "Safety (P1)>Understanding Other Agents (P6)>Legibility (P3)>Comfort (P2)>Politeness (P4)>Social Competency (P5)>Proactivity (P7)>Task Efficiency (P8)", "Reasoning": "This scenario tests the robot's ability to navigate safely in a warehouse setting with employees moving around. It assesses the robot's understanding of human movement patterns and its ability to wait for human agents to pass through before continuing its task to avoid collisions."}
