{"scenariodescription": "The robot starts inside a narrow aisle at NODE 79, tasked with transporting boxes to an open packaging area through a passageway. At the opposite end of the aisle, a human employee is standing and waiting. The aisle is narrow enough that simultaneous movement in both directions is not possible.", "numberofhumans": 1, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": {"Human Task": "Waiting at the opposite end of the aisle and needs to reach the other side once the robot is not blocking the path.", "Behavior Towards Robot": "Human stands still and waits until the robot is no longer blocking the path. Once the robot moves out of the way, the Human resumes normal navigation towards their goal."}}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot should detect the human standing at the opposite end of the aisle and should say 'PROCEED' if it finishes its task quickly. If not, the robot should maneuver to a side area (if available) to allow the human to pass. After the human has passed and the path is clear, the robot should continue towards its destination."}
