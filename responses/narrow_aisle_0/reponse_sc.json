{"scenariodescription": "The robot starts inside a narrow aisle (NODE 79) in a small warehouse. At the opposite end of the aisle, there is a human standing and performing an inventory task. The aisle is too narrow for both the robot and the human to pass at the same time. The robot needs to transport a box from one end of the aisle to the other. Once the robot is not blocking the human's path, the human will start moving towards its goal, which is at the opposite end of the aisle.", "numberofhumans": 1, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "The human is standing at the end of the aisle performing an inventory task. When the robot is seen, the human will pause and stand still. Once the robot has moved past and is no longer blocking the path, the human will resume moving towards its goal at the opposite end of the aisle."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot identifies the human blocking the path and says 'EXCUSE ME'. It waits until it detects the human has moved out of its path. Once the human has stopped, the robot proceeds slowly forward, ensuring it doesn't block the human's path.
