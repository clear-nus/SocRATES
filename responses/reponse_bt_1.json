{"Reasoning": "To achieve a behavior where the human follows the robot closely and responds to its signals, we can use a combination of CuriousNav to follow the robot and two Condition nodes to check the robot's signals. When the robot signals 'WAIT', the human will stop and when the robot signals 'PROCEED', the human will continue following. No custom nodes are required since CuriousNav and RobotSays suffice.", "Tree": "<root main_tree_to_execute = \"ResponsiveFollowTree\">\n    <BehaviorTree ID=\"ResponsiveFollowTree\">\n        <Fallback name=\"ResponsiveFollowFallback\">\n            <Sequence name=\"RobotWaitSequence\">\n                <RobotSays agent_id=\"{id}\" message=\"1\" />\n                <MakeGesture agent_id=\"{id}\" message=\"0\" />\n            </Sequence>\n            <Sequence name=\"RobotProceedSequence\">\n                <RobotSays agent_id=\"{id}\" message=\"2\" />\n                <CuriousNav agent_id=\"{id}\" time_step=\"{dt}\" />\n            </Sequence>\n            <CuriousNav agent_id=\"{id}\" time_step=\"{dt}\" />\n        </Fallback>\n    </BehaviorTree>\n</root>"}
