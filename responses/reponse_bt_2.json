{"Reasoning": "The required behavior involves checking if the robot is visible. Since visibility is obstructed and no distance parameter is specified, we assume that the robot is not visible due to the box. The human should listen for a 'WAIT' gesture message (indicated by the robot's message being 1). If 'WAIT' is heard, the human stops; otherwise, the human continues to navigate towards their goal. Since no custom nodes are needed for hearing a gesture or stopping, the standard nodes can suffice. The goal 'Hall (5)' is considered as part of the regular navigation and goal update mechanism in the provided RegularNav subtree.", "Tree": "<root main_tree_to_execute = 'StopOnWaitTree'>\n    <include path='BTRegularNav.xml'/>\n    <BehaviorTree ID='StopOnWaitTree'>\n        <Fallback name='ObstructedViewFallback'>\n            <Sequence name='WaitOnHearSequence'>\n                <RobotSays agent_id='{id}' message='1'/>\n                <Wait duration='{dt}' />\n            </Sequence>\n            <Sequence name='ContinueTowardsGoalSequence'>\n                <SetBlackboard output_key='agentid' value='{id}' />\n                <SetBlackboard output_key='timestep' value='{dt}' />\n                <SubTree ID='RegularNavTree' id='agentid' dt='timestep' />\n            </Sequence>\n        </Fallback>\n    </BehaviorTree>\n</root>", "Custom Action": "Design an Action node called 'Wait(duration)' that makes the agent stop moving but still looking around. When the node is ticked, the agent stops all navigational motion for the specified duration of time. The node should return SUCCESS after the duration has elapsed and RUNNING otherwise."}
