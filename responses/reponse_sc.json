{"Scenario Description": "The robot is tasked with delivering coffee to a meeting room on the 4th floor of the office building. The robot starts from the coffee room, navigates through a passageway, and encounters an employee coming from the opposite direction in a narrow passageway. The passageway is wide enough for only one entity to pass at a time. The encounter happens near a blind corner, adding to the navigation complexity.", "Number of Humans": 1, "Human Behavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is navigating from their lab to the coffee room. They do not notice the robot initially as it is hidden by the blind corner. Upon seeing the robot, Human 1 stops and looks at the robot before deciding to give way to the robot. They wait for the robot to pass before continuing to navigate towards the coffee room."}, "Expected Robot Behavior": "The robot proceeds through the passageway and slows down upon detecting the blind corner. Upon encountering the human, the robot says 'PROCEED' and waits for the human to give way. Once the human steps aside, the robot continues navigating through the narrow passageway towards the meeting room."}
