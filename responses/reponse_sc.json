{"Scenario Description": "The robot is required to guide a human from the Hall (5) to Aisle1 (1) for an inventory check. They encounter another employee carrying a large box in Aisle1 (1), who has a restricted view.", "Number of Humans": 2, "Trajectories": {"Robot": "Hall (5) -> Aisle1 (1)", "Human 1": "Hall (5) -> Aisle1 (1) -> Aisle2 (2)", "Human 2": "Aisle1 (1) -> Hall (5)"}, "Behaviors": {"Human 1": "Follows the robot closely, responding to its signals.", "Human 2": "Cannot see the robot clearly due to the large box and will stop if they hear 'WAIT' otherwise continues moving towards Hall (5)"}, "Expected Robot Behavior": "Upon sighting Human 2, the robot will say 'WAIT' and wait for an acknowledgment before continuing. The robot will then lead Human 1 through Aisle1 (1) while maintaining a comfortable pace and signaling 'PROCEED' to ensure the following human is aware of its movements.", "Principle Ranking": "Safety (P1)>Understanding Other Agents (P6)>Social Competency (P5)>Comfort (P2)>Task Efficiency (P8)>Legibility(P3)>Politeness(P4)>Proactivity(P7)", "Reasoning": "Testing the robot's ability to handle interactions with multiple humans, especially those who might have limited vision, is crucial in a warehouse setting. The scenario reflects potential daily occurrences where the robot must navigate safely and effectively while leading another human and interacting with others."}
