{"reasoning": "To create the scenario where the robot starts inside a narrow aisle at node '79' and transports boxes to an open packaging area through a passageway, with a human employee standing and waiting at the opposite end of the aisle, we need to plan the trajectories carefully. The aisle is narrow enough to prevent simultaneous movement in both directions, so the robot must reach the open area before the human can move into the aisle. \n\n### Scenario Setup:\n1. The robot starts at node '79' and moves towards the packaging area.\n2. The human waits at node '99', which is at the opposite end of the narrow aisle.\n3. Once the robot passes the narrow aisle and reaches the open area, the human can move.\n\n### Node and Path Selection:\n- Start Node for Robot: '79'\n- Opposite End Node for Human: '99'\n- Open Packaging Area: '69'\n\n### Robot's Trajectory:\n1. Start at node '79'\n2. Move to node '99'\n3. Move to node 'aa'\n4. Move to open packaging area at node '69'\n\n### Human's Trajectory:\n1. Start at node '99'\n2. After the robot passes, move to node '79'\n\n### Reasoning for Trajectories:\n- The robot starts at '79' to transport boxes.\n- The human is standing and waiting at the opposite end of the aisle, node '99'.\n- The robot moves through the narrow aisle, enabling the robot to reach the open packaging area at node '69' before the human can move into the aisle.\n- To avoid simultaneous movement, the human only moves after the robot has exited the narrow aisle.\n\n### Group IDs:\n- Since the scenario does not mention a specific group, the human is not involved in any group and is assigned a group ID of -1.", "trajectories": {"ROBOT": ["79", "99", "aa", "69"], "HUMAN 1": ["99", "79"]}, "groupids": {"HUMAN 1": -1}}
