{"scenario": {"scenariodescription": "The robot starts in a narrow aisle near a rack and navigates towards a wide passageway leading to an open area designated as the emergency exit. The robot encounters two humans along its path. Human 1 is initially located near a corner in one of the narrow aisles and Human 2 is situated near an intersection in the wide passageway.", "numberofhumans": 2, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 is visibly frantic and starts moving towards the robot when it becomes visible. Human 1 follows the robot after the robot makes a gesture 'FOLLOW ME'.", "Human 2": "Human 2 is cautiously moving along the passageway and hesitates when seeing the robot. Human 2 blocks the robot's path and waits for the robot's instruction. Only after the robot gestures 'PROCEED', does Human 2 give way."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot should make the 'FOLLOW ME' gesture when it first encounters Human 1, ensuring Human 1 follows it. Upon encountering Human 2, the robot should stop, make the 'PROCEED' gesture to get Human 2 to give way, and then continue guiding both humans towards the emergency exit in the open area.", "reasoning": "In an emergency situation inside a warehouse, the robot needs to effectively guide people to safety by using gestures that humans can quickly understand. Human 1's frantic behavior and willingness to follow can be emulated in the simulation by programming the human cylinder to follow the robot upon detecting its 'FOLLOW ME' gesture. Human 2's cautious and blocking behavior can be emulated by making the cylinder block the robot's path until it receives the 'PROCEED' gesture, after which it moves aside."}, "groupids": {"human1": -1, "human2": -1}, "trajectories": {"robot": ["11", "07", "f7", "d9", "aa", "69", "cf"], "human1": ["07"], "human2": ["d9"]}, "behavior_trees": {"Human 1": "<root main_tree_to_execute='FranticHumanTree'>\n    <BehaviorTree ID='FranticHumanTree'>\n        <Fallback name='FranticBehaviorFallback'>\n            <Sequence name='MoveTowardsRobotSequence'>\n                <IsRobotVisible agent_id='{id}' distance='4.0'/>\n                <LookAtRobot agent_id='{id}'/>\n                <RobotSays agent_id='{id}' message='2'/>\n                <FollowRobot agent_id='{id}' time_step='{dt}'/>\n            </Sequence>\n            <Sequence name='IdleBehavior'>\n                <SetBlackboard output_key='agentid' value='{id}'/>\n                <SetBlackboard output_key='timestep' value='{dt}'/>\n                <SubTree ID='RegularNavTree' id='agentid' dt='timestep'/>\n            </Sequence>\n        </Fallback>\n    </BehaviorTree>\n</root>", "Human 2": "<root main_tree_to_execute='HumanCautiousTree'>\n    <include path='BTRegularNav.xml'/>\n    <BehaviorTree ID='HumanCautiousTree'>\n        <Fallback name='CautiousMovementFallback'>\n            <Sequence name='RoboticInteractionSequence'>\n                <IsRobotVisible agent_id='{id}' distance='4.0'/>\n                <BlockRobot agent_id='{id}' time_step='{dt}'/>\n                <RobotSays agent_id='{id}' message='2'/>\n                <GiveWaytoRobot agent_id='{id}' time_step='{dt}'/>\n            </Sequence>\n            <Sequence name='RegularNavigationSequence'>\n                <SetBlackboard output_key='agentid' value='{id}'/>\n                <SetBlackboard output_key='timestep' value='{dt}'/>\n                <SubTree ID='RegularNavTree' id='agentid' dt='timestep'/>\n            </Sequence>\n        </Fallback>\n    </BehaviorTree>\n</root>"}}
