{"scenario": {"scenariodescription": "The robot starts at an open area in the warehouse and is tasked with guiding two humans to safety. Human 1 is located at the intersection of a narrow aisle and a wide passageway. Human 2 is located near the packaging area. The robot first approaches Human 1, who is visibly distressed and unsure of the direction to safety. The robot then proceeds to Human 2, who is trying to navigate around the packaging area. The robot guides Human 1 through a narrow passageway, then directs Human 2 through a corner towards the safety exit located at another open area.", "numberofhumans": 2, "humanbehavior": {"Human 1": "Human 1 looks in the direction of the robot upon seeing it, follows the robot when the robot gestures 'PROCEED', and occasionally stops to ensure the robot is still visible.", "Human 2": "Human 2 initially tries to navigate independently but stops and follows the robot when it approaches and gestures 'PROCEED'. Human 2 continues to move as long as the robot gestures 'PROCEED'."}, "expectedrobotbehavior": "The robot should first move to Human 1 and gesture 'PROCEED' to guide them through the narrow passageway. The robot must ensure Human 1 is safely following before navigating towards Human 2. Upon reaching Human 2, the robot should gesture 'PROCEED' again and guide Human 2 towards the safety exit. The robot should periodically look back to ensure both humans are following and adjust its pace accordingly.", "reasoning": "In an emergency, the robot should prioritize guiding humans to safety, ensuring that the humans can see and follow it. Human behaviors such as looking in the direction of the robot, following the robot when instructed, and occasionally stopping can be effectively emulated using the sensors and movement capabilities of cylindrical human models in the simulation. The robot's behavior of gesturing and ensuring the humans are following can be programmed to make the scenario realistic and validate the robot's social navigation capabilities in a disaster situation."}, "groupids": {"human1": 1, "human2": 1}, "trajectories": {"robot": ["fd", "d4", "b4", "06", "c2", "a8", "f3", "ab", "1d"], "human1": ["d4", "b4", "06", "c2", "a8", "f3", "ab", "1d"], "human2": ["06", "c2", "a8", "f3", "ab", "1d"]}, "behavior_trees": {"human1": "<root main_tree_to_execute=\"HumanBehaviorTree\">\n    <BehaviorTree ID=\"HumanBehaviorTree\">\n        <Fallback name=\"MainFallback\">\n            <Sequence name=\"LookAndFollowSequence\">\n                <IsRobotVisible agent_id=\"{id}\" distance=\"5.0\"/>\n                <LookAtRobot agent_id=\"{id}\"/>\n                <RobotSays agent_id=\"{id}\" message=\"2\"/>\n                <FollowRobot agent_id=\"{id}\" time_step=\"{dt}\"/>\n                <TimeExpiredCondition seconds=\"5.0\" ts=\"{dt}\" only_once=\"false\"/>\n                <IsRobotVisible agent_id=\"{id}\" distance=\"5.0\"/>\n            </Sequence>\n            <Sequence name=\"RegularNavSequence\">\n                <SetBlackboard output_key=\"agentid\" value=\"{id}\"/>\n                <SetBlackboard output_key=\"timestep\" value=\"{dt}\"/>\n                <SubTree ID=\"RegularNavTree\" id=\"agentid\" dt=\"timestep\"/>\n            </Sequence>\n        </Fallback>\n    </BehaviorTree>\n</root>", "human2": "<root main_tree_to_execute='IndependentOrFollowRobotTree'>\n    <include path='BTRegularNav.xml'/>\n    <BehaviorTree ID='IndependentOrFollowRobotTree'>\n        <Fallback name='NavigateOrFollowFallback'>\n            <Sequence name='FollowRobotSequence'>\n                <IsRobotVisible agent_id='{id}' distance='4.0'/>\n                <RobotSays agent_id='{id}' message='2'/>\n                <MakeGesture agent_id='{id}' message='0'/>\n                <SetBlackboard output_key='agentid' value='{id}'/>\n                <SetBlackboard output_key='timestep' value='{dt}'/>\n                <FollowRobot agent_id='{id}' time_step='{dt}'/>\n            </Sequence>\n            <Sequence name='IndependentNavSequence'>\n                <MakeGesture agent_id='{id}' message='0'/>\n                <SetBlackboard output_key='agentid' value='{id}'/>\n                <SetBlackboard output_key='timestep' value='{dt}'/>\n                <SubTree ID='RegularNavTree' id='agentid' dt='timestep'/> <!-- Using Regular Navigation as SubTree -->\n            </Sequence>\n        </Fallback>\n    </BehaviorTree>\n</root>"}}
