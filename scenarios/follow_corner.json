{"scenario": "{\"scenariodescription\":\"The robot, tasked with cleaning duties, starts from an open area and proceeds through a narrow passageway towards a storage rack section. Human 1, an employee, follows the robot at a close distance as they need to access the same aisle for inspecting inventory. As the robot approaches a blind corner at the end of the aisle, Human 2, another employee, comes from the opposite direction. Since the corner is blind, Human 2 is unaware of the robot's presence until both arrive at the corner simultaneously.\",\"numberofhumans\":2,\"humanbehavior\":[{\"name\":\"Human 1\",\"behavior\":\"Human 1 follows the robot closely as it navigates the narrow passageway, periodically checking if the robot is moving. If the robot stops suddenly, Human 1 halts its movement until the robot continues.\"},{\"name\":\"Human 2\",\"behavior\":\"As Human 2 turns the blind corner and sees the robot, they immediately stop. If the robot acknowledges their presence with a gesture 'EXCUSE ME', Human 2 will step aside, allowing the robot to pass.\"}],\"reasoning\":\"This scenario mimics a typical warehouse interaction where employees and the cleaning robot share confined spaces. Human 1's behavior tests whether the robot can maintain awareness of being followed. Human 2's reaction tests the robot's ability to acknowledge and navigate around unexpected human encounters at blind intersections. The scenario also evaluates the robot's capability for timely response in communicating 'EXCUSE ME' to gain passage rights, which can be essential in tight, busy environments like warehouses.\"}", "groupids": {"human1": -1, "human2": -1}, "trajectories": {"human1": ["3a", "ca", "c4", "f7", "f2"], "human2": ["df", "f2"], "robot": ["3a", "ca", "c4", "f7", "f2"]}, "interaction_points": {"human1": "f2", "human2": "f2"}, "behavior_trees": {"human1": "<root main_tree_to_execute='FollowAndHaltTree'>\n    <BehaviorTree ID='FollowAndHaltTree'>\n        <Fallback name='FollowRobotFallback'>\n            <Sequence name='FollowRobotSequence'>\n                <RobotMoved agent_id='{id}'/>\n                <FollowRobot agent_id='{id}' time_step='{dt}'/>\n            </Sequence>\n            <MakeGesture agent_id='{id}' message='0'/>\n        </Fallback>\n    </BehaviorTree>\n</root>", "human2": "<root main_tree_to_execute=\"HumanBlindCornerTree\">\n    <BehaviorTree ID=\"HumanBlindCornerTree\">\n        <Fallback name=\"CornerInteractionFallback\">\n            <Sequence name=\"DetectAndRespondSequence\">\n                <IsRobotVisible agent_id=\"{id}\" distance=\"4.0\" />\n                <MakeGesture agent_id=\"{id}\" message=\"0\" /> <!-- Stop action -->\n                <RobotSays agent_id=\"{id}\" message=\"4\" /> <!-- EXCUSE ME gesture -->\n                <GiveWaytoRobot agent_id=\"{id}\" time_step=\"{dt}\" /> <!-- Step aside -->\n            </Sequence>\n            <Sequence name=\"DoNothingSequence\">\n                <MakeGesture agent_id=\"{id}\" message=\"0\" /> <!-- Default no action if conditions not met -->\n            </Sequence>\n        </Fallback>\n    </BehaviorTree>\n</root>"}}
